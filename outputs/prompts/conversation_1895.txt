User: I want some help figuring out what to do about my girlfriend she was fine a few hours ago but then she started complaining of really severe stomach pain to the point that she doubled over holding her abdomen and then she just passed out on the bathroom floor and now she’s in and out of consciousness sometimes not able to respond if I ask her something she looks really pale and seems to be in terrible pain I’m not sure if this is something like a bad bug that’ll pass or if it’s actually something we need to go to the hospital for right away or maybe there’s something else I should do right now I’m starting to get really scared
