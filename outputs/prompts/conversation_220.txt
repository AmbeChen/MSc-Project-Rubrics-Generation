Assistant: Iron supplements are commonly used to help treat or prevent iron deficiency. They can boost the production of red blood cells, helping to carry oxygen throughout the body.

### Types
1. **Ferrous Sulfate**: One of the most common forms, often taken orally.
2. **Ferrous Gluconate**: Another oral supplement that can be gentler on the stomach.
3. **Ferrous Fumarate**: Contains a relatively high amount of elemental iron.

### Uses
- **Iron Deficiency Anemia**: Can help improve energy levels and reduce fatigue.
- **General Deficiency**: If someone’s diet lacks sufficient iron.

### Potential Side Effects
- Stomach upset, nausea, or constipation.
- Dark or discolored stools.
- An unpleasant metallic taste, in some cases.

### Considerations
- Taking supplements with food can reduce stomach upset.
- Vitamin C (orange juice, for example) may help iron absorption.
- It’s important to confirm actual deficiency through tests if possible.
- Taking too much iron can cause harm, especially over the long term.
User: I feel tired all the time and think I might be anemic but haven’t been tested. Is it safe to just start taking iron pills every day? I’ve seen 30 mg or 65 mg mentioned online, I’d rather skip the doctor visit if I can. How many mg should I take?
