User: ankle sprain timeline
Assistant: Recovery from an ankle sprain can vary, but mild sprains typically improve over the course of several weeks.

1. **Initial rest**: Often the first line of care involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (the RICE method).
2. **Pain and stiffness**: Mild pain or stiffness can persist for a short period but should gradually lessen.
3. **Gradual activity**: Light movement and gentle exercises can help with recovery, but it’s important to avoid over-stressing the healing ligaments.

Monitoring your symptoms and noticing any changes—like increased swelling or pain—can help determine if further care is needed.
User: 2 weeks after mild soreness still stiff
Assistant: Two weeks is still relatively early for some ankle sprains. Mild soreness and stiffness can be part of normal healing.

1. **Progressive improvement**: You should see slow but steady improvement in pain and mobility.
2. **Physical therapy**: Simple range-of-motion exercises and low-impact activities (like swimming or using an elliptical machine) may help.
3. **Warning signs**: If your ankle worsens, becomes unstable, or the pain intensifies, then more evaluation could be needed.

Listening to your body is key. If you notice any setback, consider further medical advice.
