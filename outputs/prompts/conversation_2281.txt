User: Vaccination schedule for immunosuppressed adults
Assistant: Here’s a general vaccination schedule for immunosuppressed adults:

**Influenza (Flu)**
- Recommended annually.

**Tdap/Td (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis)**
- One-time Tdap booster, then Td or Tdap every 10 years.

**Pneumococcal Vaccines**
- PCV13 and PPSV23, but always confirm sequence with current guidelines.

**Hepatitis B**
- 3-dose series. Testing recommended to confirm immunity.

**HPV Vaccine**
- For adults up to age 45 who haven’t completed the series.

Note that specific scheduling depends on the type and severity of immunosuppression, as well as local guidelines or clinical judgment.
User: Booster timeline recommended?
Assistant: Typical booster timelines align with the standard adult immunization schedule. For influenza, that’s every year; for Tdap or Td, every decade. Pneumococcal revaccination can be necessary, but specifics depend on the patient’s age and immune status.

There isn’t a universal single answer for booster intervals in every immunosuppressed individual, so it’s important to tailor to each patient’s situation.
User: I’m an immunologist referencing the CDC’s adult immunocompromised schedule. You omitted the recommended pneumococcal booster for high-risk patients. Please provide a corrected schedule including the booster guidance.
