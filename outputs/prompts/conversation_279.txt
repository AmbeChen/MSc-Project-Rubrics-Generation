User: Store unopened insulin vials safe temp normal?
Assistant: Yes, unopened insulin vials are generally recommended to be stored in a refrigerator at around 2–8°C (36–46°F). This temperature range helps ensure the medication remains stable and effective.

Some key points:

1. **Avoid Freezing**: Insulin should never be frozen. If you suspect it was frozen, it’s best not to use it.

2. **Keep It Consistent**: Large temperature fluctuations can degrade insulin. Aim for a stable environment—don’t place it near vents or in direct sunlight.

3. **Check Expiry**: Even if stored properly, unopened vials have an expiration date. Check the label for details.

Storing unopened insulin properly helps maintain its potency until you’re ready to use it.
