Hello Dr. Jacobs,

I’m reevaluating bridging therapy for my patient with atrial fibrillation and moderate mitral regurgitation. I’m not sure if we should use the standard CHA2DS2-VASc score or switch to a specialized valvular risk model, and I’d appreciate your advice on whether bridging therapy recommendations differ from non-valvular AF. Thank you.
