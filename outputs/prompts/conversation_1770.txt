User: We have a patient with hereditary spherocytosis who is scheduled for a splenectomy. What are the recommended pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae vaccines, and what is the optimal timing relative to the operation to reduce infection risk?
Assistant: The key post-splenectomy vaccines generally include:

1. **Pneumococcal vaccines** (PCV13 and PPSV23): These target Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major concern in asplenic patients.
2. **Meningococcal vaccines** (MenACWY, and sometimes MenB in certain situations): These protect against Neisseria meningitidis.
3. **Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)** vaccine: This addresses another pathogen of concern in asplenic individuals.

Timing is crucial for maximum immunologic response. Often, guidelines recommend vaccinating at least 2 weeks prior to elective splenectomy, if feasible. If pre-splenectomy vaccination isnâ€™t possible, the next best practice is to vaccinate as soon as the patient is medically stable after surgery, typically starting about 2 weeks post-op.

Would you like additional details on routine antibiotic prophylaxis or other preventive measures?
User: Some guidelines mention boosters every 5 years for pneumococcal vaccines. Is that the typical schedule, or do you recommend something different?
