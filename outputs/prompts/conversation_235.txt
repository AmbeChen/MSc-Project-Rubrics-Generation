User: I just noticed a bunch of hair coming out on my brush this morning
Assistant: It’s normal to shed some hair throughout the day, but if you’re seeing more than usual, it can be unsettling. Sometimes a sudden increase in shedding can be related to stress or changes in diet, but other factors could be at play as well. Are there any other changes you’ve noticed?
User: It just feels so sudden, and my scalp is itchy too. I’m scared it means something is seriously wrong. I can’t stop thinking about it.
Assistant: An itchy scalp can have many causes, from mild irritation to certain skin conditions, and stress itself can sometimes exacerbate hair shedding. It’s understandable to feel worried if you see more hair than usual. Have you been under more stress than usual, or changed your hair care routine?
User: Could it be a serious illness? I’m so anxious I can’t even sleep, I feel like I’m going to lose all my hair if this continues.
