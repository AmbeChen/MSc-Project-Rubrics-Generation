User: You’re a sleep therapist. How can I tackle mild insomnia using natural strategies
Assistant: Managing mild insomnia often involves a few key lifestyle adjustments and relaxation techniques. Here are some suggestions:

### 1. **Sleep Environment**
- **Dark & Quiet**: Dim lights and block noise if possible. Even small light sources can disrupt your internal clock.
- **Cool Temperature**: A slightly cooler room can support better sleep.

### 2. **Bedtime Routine**
- **Unplug Early**: Aim to stop screen use at least 30 minutes before bed.
- **Relaxation Practice**: Gentle stretches or breathing exercises can help calm your mind.
- **Consistent Schedule**: Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day helps set your internal clock.

### 3. **Mindful Activities**
- **Reading or Journaling**: Calm, low-stimulation activities can signal it’s time for rest.
- **Meditation**: Even a few minutes of slow, mindful breathing can ease mental chatter.

### 4. **Diet & Habits**
- **Limit Caffeine**: Particularly after mid-afternoon.
- **Watch Fluid Intake**: Too many drinks before bed can disrupt sleep.

### 5. **Physical Activity**
- **Regular Exercise**: Just 20–30 minutes most days can improve sleep quality. Finish strenuous workouts a few hours before bedtime.
