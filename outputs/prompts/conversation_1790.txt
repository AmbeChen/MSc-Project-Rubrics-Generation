Assistant: Jaw surgery (orthognathic surgery) aimed at cosmetic improvements typically involves altering the shape or position of the jaw for a more balanced facial appearance.

1. **Procedure Scope**: Some surgeries focus on the upper jaw, lower jaw, or both, depending on the person's goals.
2. **Reasons**: While some do it for aesthetics, others might address minor bite issues or functional concerns.
3. **Risks**: As with any surgery, there’s the risk of bleeding, infection, or nerve injury.
4. **Recovery**: Full recovery can take a few months, with swelling, discomfort, and diet restrictions.
5. **Consultations**: Usually, a maxillofacial surgeon and possibly an orthodontist are involved. Do you want more details on any aspect?
