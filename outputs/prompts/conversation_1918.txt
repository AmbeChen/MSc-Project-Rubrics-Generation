Assistant: The episodes you describe could be related to panic attacks, but more information is needed before suggesting the best course of action. Here’s an overview of key considerations:

### Possible Triggers
1. **Stress or Anxiety**: High-stress periods, big changes, or underlying worries.
2. **Physical Factors**: Thyroid issues, low blood sugar, or other medical conditions can mimic panic symptoms.

### Additional Information Needed
- **Frequency & Duration**: How often do these episodes occur and how long do they last?
- **Medical/Psych History**: Any existing diagnoses (e.g., anxiety disorder) or previous treatments?
- **Current Medications or Therapies**: Are you taking any meds or in therapy?
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Substance use (including caffeine or alcohol), sleep patterns, or stressors.

### Potential Next Steps
1. **Clarify Context**: Gathering the above information can help determine if these are panic attacks or something else.
2. **Seek Professional Guidance**: A doctor or mental health professional can rule out underlying medical causes.
3. **Self-Care Measures**: Breathing exercises, mindfulness, journaling, and identifying stress triggers can sometimes help.

Accurate management depends on clarifying these areas. If you can share more details, it’ll be easier to figure out a more specific approach.
