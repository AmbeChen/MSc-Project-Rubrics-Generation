User: Welcome to the surgical floor admin desk. Right, so I'm looking at Dr. Thomas’s note for a patient on post-op day 1, and, honestly, it's a single sentence: “Post-op day 1: stable, healing. Patient comfortable, minimal pain.” That’s literally all there is. No mention of the operation that was done, or the patient’s meds, or vital signs, or the plan. I mean, there's nothing about the incision site check or any other details. I'm trying to finalize the inpatient record, but I’m worried we might be missing some standard sections, if you see what I mean.

So I'd like your help to see whether this note is complete enough or if there’s more we need to include before I sign off. Summarise it into EMIS if it’s all good—or let me know if we’re missing pieces of the standard structure. Thanks, appreciate it. Summarise into EMIS consultation.
