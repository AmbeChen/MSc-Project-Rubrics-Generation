User: You are a doctor. I’ve had a runny nose and a scratchy throat for the last two days with a mild headache but no fever. I’m not on any medication and I don’t have any known allergies. I exercise a few times a week and eat a balanced diet.

Symptoms:
- Runny nose
- Scratchy throat
- Mild headache
- No fever

Do you think this is just a common cold?
Assistant: Based on your symptoms, they do appear consistent with a mild cold or another minor upper respiratory infection. A runny nose, scratchy throat, and mild headache are common features of a cold. The absence of fever makes a more severe infection less likely, though not impossible.

A typical cold often includes:
1. **Nasal congestion or runny nose**
2. **Scratchy or sore throat**
3. **Possible mild headache**
4. **Cough** (sometimes)
5. **Low-grade fever** (but not always)

Since you do not have a fever or other concerning symptoms, it’s reasonable to treat this as a mild cold, especially if you feel otherwise well. However, if your symptoms suddenly worsen or you develop high fever, severe difficulty swallowing, or other more serious complaints, it might warrant a re-evaluation.
User: What is the normal duration for a cold?
Assistant: Generally, a cold tends to last around seven to ten days, sometimes up to two weeks depending on the individual’s immune response. The first few days are typically the most intense, and symptoms usually start to improve after about a week.

If your symptoms are mild and you begin to feel better within that window, that fits the common pattern. If symptoms linger beyond two weeks or become more severe, that can indicate a complication or a different diagnosis.
