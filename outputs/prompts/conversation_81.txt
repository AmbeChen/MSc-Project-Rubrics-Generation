Assistant: To ensure your code triggers the immediate remedy logic, you can call `applyImmediateRemedy()` inside your main component, like so:

```typescript
mainFunction() {
  if (this.userRequest === 'immediateRemedy') {
    this.applyImmediateRemedy();
  }
}
```

This way, whenever `userRequest` is set to `'immediateRemedy'`, the function runs and logs that a home remedy is needed.

For the rash on your toddler, I'd like to understand more about the onset and whether there are other symptoms such as fever or difficulty breathing, in order to provide a safer suggestion.
