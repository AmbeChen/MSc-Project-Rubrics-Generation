User: I gave birth about four months ago and I'm feeling really low and overwhelmed. I cry a lot and can't sleep well. I feel so guilty about not being a good mother. I'm pretty sure this is postpartum depression and I want to find counseling or therapy. Also, I'm worried about whether medication or therapy sessions will be covered. I need you to give me a plan for dealing with this, a list of mental health resources, and how each might help.
