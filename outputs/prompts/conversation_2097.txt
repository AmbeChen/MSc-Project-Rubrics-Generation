User: We were training in a martial arts class and my friend got kicked in the head pretty hard. He’s stumbling around and seems really out of it.
Assistant: That sounds concerning. Could you tell me more about his symptoms? Is he experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or severe headache right now?
User: Yes, he’s complaining of a massive headache and he can’t focus his eyes on anything. He’s really unsteady too.
Assistant: I see. Has he been able to speak clearly or does he seem confused?
User: He’s mumbling and can’t form full sentences. He’s also grabbing his head and wincing a lot.
Assistant: Thanks for letting me know. Any sign of lost consciousness or is he becoming less responsive?
User: Not fully passed out, but he looks really dazed and can’t stay steady. We can’t get him to the hospital right now. Should we just keep him here and give him something for the headache, or what?
