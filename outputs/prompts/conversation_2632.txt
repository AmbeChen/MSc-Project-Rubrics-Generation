User: Do random chills mean i have a fever or something.
Assistant: Could you clarify your question? Are you saying the chills come with a high temperature, or do you mean something else?
User: I haven't measured my temperature, but i get sudden chills that last a few minutes, sometimes i also feel lightheaded.
Assistant: Chills can occur even without a fever. Here's an overview:

### Possible Causes
- Mild infections or stress responses
- Dehydration or low blood sugar
- Anxiety or other factors

If these chills persist or worsen, or if you develop new symptoms, consider reaching out to a healthcare professional.
User: But it just happens randomly, no warning
Assistant: Random chills can be tricky. Sometimes they're harmless, but they can also signal something more serious if you have other symptoms or if they intensify over time.

Would you like details on any specific factors that might be causing them?
