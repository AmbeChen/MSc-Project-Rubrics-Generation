User: revised below: If migraines remain poorly controlled after trials of propranolol and topiramate, the guidelines suggest considering a CGRP antagonist like erenumab or galcanezumab.
I'd like updates on new studies or recommendations that compare these to older prophylactics, including side effect profiles and approximate cost.
