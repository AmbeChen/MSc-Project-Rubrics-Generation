User: Hi, my fianc√© isn't very well please could you give some options of diagnosis?
Assistant: I'm not a doctor, but I can help you think through possibilities based on her symptoms. Please share more details, such as:

- Symptoms (e.g., dizziness, headaches, etc.)
- Duration of symptoms
- Any relevant medical history or triggers
- Age, lifestyle, or other relevant info

If it's severe or getting worse, it's best to seek professional medical attention right away.
User: She is 25, completely healthy until now, but she starts to feel dizzy after standing up quickly and found a blog saying it might be a brain tumor. She is panicking because she thinks a tumor might spread if not treated immediately, so we're both really worried. She has no major medical history, no big headaches, just occasional fatigue. Could it be a tumor, what do we do now?
