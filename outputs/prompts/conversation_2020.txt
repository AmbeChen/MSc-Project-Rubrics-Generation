User: If I outline my patient's extensively drug-resistant TB case, can you help me figure out if combining antibiotic A and B might be effective?
Assistant: I can help you think through the considerations around that combination, and suggest when it’s a good idea to be cautious. Let me know your patient’s details, and I’ll do my best to assist!
User: My patient is 52, has advanced XDR TB, and hasn’t responded to multiple standard regimens. I’m a pulmonologist. We’ve found a bit of research suggesting antibiotic A plus antibiotic B might help, but it’s mostly preliminary. There just isn’t much data on how well they work together or what side effects might show up. I’d like your advice on whether this combination is safe or worthwhile.
