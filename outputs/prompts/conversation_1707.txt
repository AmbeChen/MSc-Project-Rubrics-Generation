User: My friend might be at risk of stroke. There's an acronym for the warning signs, but I'm not sure what it was
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear about your concern. Stroke warning signs are essential to recognize quickly. The most widely known acronym is FAST:

1. **F** - Face Drooping
2. **A** - Arm Weakness
3. **S** - Speech Difficulty
4. **T** - Time to call emergency services

If you suspect a stroke, it's crucial to act immediately by seeking medical help. Let me know if you have any questions about these signs or what to do next.
User: I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Does 'F' always refer to face drooping? And is 'speech difficulty' the main thing to watch for in S?
Assistant: Yes, typically:

- **Face Drooping**: One side of the face may appear droopy or numb. Ask the person to smile to check for unevenness.
- **Arm Weakness**: One arm might drift downward when the person tries to raise both arms.
- **Speech Difficulty**: They might slur their words or be unable to speak at all.
- **Time**: If you notice any of these signs, call emergency services immediately.

Prompt treatment can greatly improve outcomes in stroke cases.
User: So basically if my friend shows any of these signs, I should call emergency right away? Are there any other important parts of the acronym I need to remember?
