User: the patient has a creatinine clearance of 25 ml/min and i'm using enoxaparin for vte prophylaxis. is 40 mg once daily correct or should it be reduced to 30 mg daily due to bleeding risk
Assistant: For a patient with a creatinine clearance of 25 ml/min, enoxaparin prophylaxis generally needs a lower dose than 40 mg once daily to minimize bleeding risk. Guidelines often recommend 30 mg once daily in severe renal impairment. This adjustment helps balance the risk of thrombosis against the risk of bleeding.
User: can you simplify it
