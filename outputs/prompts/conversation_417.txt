User: Why are my hands getting so dry from all the washing
Assistant: Frequent handwashing can remove your skin’s natural oils, causing dryness and sometimes mild irritation. Hot water and certain soaps, especially antibacterial ones, can worsen this effect by stripping away protective moisture. You can usually help prevent dryness by using gentle, fragrance-free cleansers, patting your hands dry, and applying a moisturizer immediately afterward.
User: My skin is a bit itchy, and there’s some redness, but no cracks that are bleeding or anything
Assistant: A bit of itchiness and mild redness often indicate irritated skin or early signs of dryness. Here are some steps you can try:

1. **Moisturizing** – Use a thick cream or ointment immediately after washing and drying your hands.
2. **Protecting** – Consider wearing gloves when cleaning or doing dishes to avoid exposure to harsh chemicals.
3. **Avoiding irritants** – Skip heavily scented soaps or lotions that might worsen dryness.
4. **Gentle washing** – Use lukewarm water and a mild, unscented soap.

If your symptoms persist or worsen, it’s a good idea to seek professional advice. But many mild cases of dryness improve with consistent home care.
User: It’s been going on for a while now, close to a month, but there’s no major pain. Is it serious
Assistant: Persistent dryness over a month can still be within the realm of chronic irritation, particularly if you’ve been washing your hands frequently. If you haven’t noticed any severe peeling, deep cracks, or signs of infection—such as swelling or pus—it’s often not serious. However, it’s wise to keep an eye out for any changes and keep up with moisturizing to support skin healing.
