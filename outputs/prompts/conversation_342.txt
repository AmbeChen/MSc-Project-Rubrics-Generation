User: toddler fever
Assistant: **Fever in Toddlers** generally means a body temperature above the typical range (around 37°C). It’s a common sign that their immune system is actively responding to an infection or other cause.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Viral Infections**: Such as colds or flu.
2. **Bacterial Infections**: Examples include ear infections or pneumonia.
3. **Teething**: May cause slightly elevated temperature, though usually not very high.

### Recognising Symptoms:
- Irritability or fussiness
- Reduced energy or appetite
- Warm or sweaty skin
- Possible accompanying issues like cough or runny nose

### When to Seek Help:
- **High or persistent fever** that does not respond to usual measures
- Signs of dehydration, such as reduced urination or dry mouth
- Excessive sleepiness or difficulty waking
- A rash or other unexpected symptoms

### Possible Management Steps:
- Light clothing and ensuring adequate fluid intake
- Over-the-counter medications like children’s acetaminophen or ibuprofen (following paediatric dosing guidelines)
- Monitoring the toddler’s temperature and overall comfort

### Important Note:
A paediatrician may suggest different treatments depending on the cause, the toddler’s age, and their medical history. Let me know if you’d like more details on specific symptoms or any warning signs.
