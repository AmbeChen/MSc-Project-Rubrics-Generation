User: I'm feeling dehydrated. I started vomiting early this morning. I threw up twice and I'm still feeling a bit dizzy. I can keep water and tea down now. I don't have a high fever. Is that good? Is it safe to wait a day? Or should I go to the ER if it doesn't get better within 24 hours? I'm worried about dehydration. Should I drink more water?
