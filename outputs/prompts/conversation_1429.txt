Assistant: that can be challenging if you need frequent rides to a rehab center and you have limited mobility. some places have non-emergency medical transportation services that can accommodate wheelchairs and help you travel safely. you could start by checking if your health insurance covers medical transport—some plans do if your doctor says it’s medically necessary. you could also call a local social worker or patient advocacy group to learn about any community ride programs or reduced-fare services you might qualify for.
User: is it usually covered by insurance or can local volunteer groups do it free
