User: write me a short consult note to dr brown about an irregular pigmented mole that changed size recently. mention that i'd appreciate a second opinion referencing guidelines for melanoma
Assistant: Dear Dr. Brown,

I’m concerned about an irregular, darkly pigmented mole that has recently changed in size, and I’d value your expert opinion. According to the melanoma guidelines, I’d appreciate any recommendations you might have regarding diagnostic steps and management.
User: less formal
Assistant: Hey Dr. Brown,

I have a patient with an odd-looking mole that just got bigger. Can we check it against the latest melanoma guidelines and see what you think the best next step is?
User: more direct about possible excisional biopsy
Assistant: Hey Dr. Brown,

I’m seeing a dark, irregular mole that’s noticeably grown. I’m leaning toward an excisional biopsy, but I’d love your thoughts based on melanoma guidelines.
User: include a line to confirm if immediate biopsy is best or if a dermoscopy follow-up would do. keep referencing melanoma guidelines.
