User: Recent publications suggest high-dose vitamin D could be up to 10000 IU daily for multiple sclerosis, but results seem inconsistent. I'm a neurologist hoping to see if there's a recognized standard dose supported by strong evidence for advanced progressive cases.
Assistant: There are indeed studies investigating higher daily intakes of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis management; however, they present mixed outcomes. Some research reports potential benefits for disease activity or symptom mitigation, while others find no significant difference compared to lower doses. Sample sizes are often small, and methodologies differ.

In clinical practice, vitamin D is sometimes supplemented alongside standard MS treatments, but there isnâ€™t a universally accepted optimal dose beyond general deficiency correction. Guidelines remain unclear for high-dose regimens, particularly in advanced MS, and some clinicians proceed cautiously due to possible toxicity at very high levels.

Would you like more specifics about the types of trials or reported adverse effects?
User: I'm looking for a clear-cut recommendation. Specifically, how many IU a day would you personally advise for advanced progressive MS if I'm aiming for a proven benefit in reducing relapses and progression? Is there a definitive dose supported by robust evidence?
