User: I am writing progress notes for my ndis client.

1400- I started my shift and John was finishing his shower. He mentioned that the GP recommended using clobetasol once a day for dryness on his left leg.
1500- We visited the pharmacy for some groceries. He was stable, no complaints.
2000- He took his evening medication and resumed watching a movie.
Now I'm looking into whether there are any reasons not to use clobetasol for him. I have no further information about the lesion or any other issues.
