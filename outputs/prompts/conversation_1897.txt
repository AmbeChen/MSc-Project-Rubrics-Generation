The patient is a 15-year-old diagnosed with bulimia nervosa, currently in partial remission, with documented binge–purge episodes. Physical exam notable only for mild enamel erosion. We had a 50-minute therapy session focusing on cognitive behavioral strategies. Our treatment plan includes weekly therapy sessions for a total of eight weeks. I’d like the ICD-10 code for bulimia as well as the CPT code for a 50-minute psychotherapy session. Thank you.
