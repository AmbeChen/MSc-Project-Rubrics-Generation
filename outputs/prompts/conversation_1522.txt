User: Can you convert the transcript from my last prenatal check with a 24-week pregnant patient into a SOAP note? The patient is complaining of mild lower back pain for the last 10 days, rating it 3/10, worse at night, occasional leg cramps, and difficulty sleeping. She denies any vaginal bleeding or contractions, and she reports feeling fetal movements regularly.

1) Subjective: Mild lower back pain, occasional leg cramps, trouble sleeping, pain scale 3/10. Denies bleeding or contractions.
2) Objective: Fundal height consistent with 24 weeks, fetal heart rate at 145 bpm, normal blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, normal reflexes in lower extremities, no swelling.
3) Assessment: Normal pregnancy discomfort, possibly linked to posture changes or mild vitamin deficiency.
4) Plan: Daily stretching exercises, magnesium supplements, next prenatal visit in 4 weeks.

We also advised the patient to continue staying hydrated and monitor any changes in her symptoms. Please generate a SOAP note in standard format, with separate S, O, A, and P sections, incorporating any clarifications or suggestions you think are relevant. Thank you.
