User: I am writing a quick note to my pediatric GI colleague about a 12-year-old patient with severe upper abdominal pain and significantly elevated lipase, suggesting acute pancreatitis with no clear etiology. Below is my draft. I’d like suggestions for the flow while keeping the same tone, and I’d appreciate expansions on recommended imaging, labs, or anything else we might be missing that could explain this.

Colleague,

This 12-year-old has had 24 hours of severe upper abdominal pain. Lipase is roughly six times normal. No gallstones, no relevant family history. I’m leaning toward pancreatitis, but the cause is unclear at this point. Wondering what labs or imaging you’d recommend and if you see any red flags for other diagnoses?

Thanks so much!

**Colleague,**

I’m consulting on a 12-year-old presenting with 24 hours of severe upper abdominal pain. The patient’s lipase is about six times the upper limit of normal. There’s no evidence of gallstones or relevant family history, so the etiology remains unclear. I’m considering acute pancreatitis, but I want to ensure we aren’t missing another possible cause.

Would you recommend an abdominal ultrasound, MRI, or additional labs (like triglycerides and liver function tests) per pediatric guidelines? Let me know if you see any red flags for alternative diagnoses or further imaging to rule out other issues.

Thanks for your expertise!

I added a brief mention of imaging (ultrasound or MRI) and extra labs (e.g., lipid panel, LFTs) which are often considered, along with a subtle reference to pediatric guidelines. Is this closer to what you want?
User: I’m also sending a quick text update to another colleague who asked about the case. I want to keep the tone concise and collegial while highlighting the next steps. Below is what I have so far—any suggestions?

Hey there,

Just wanted to let you know this 12-year-old’s labs are pointing to acute pancreatitis, but the cause is unclear. We’re ordering more labs (lipid panel, LFTs) and imaging (likely ultrasound, maybe MRI) based on pediatric recommendations. No sign of gallstones or familial issues so far.

Anything else you think I should be checking or considering?

Thanks!
