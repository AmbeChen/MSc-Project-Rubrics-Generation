User: do you have any references on prescribing cannabis for pregnant women with neuropathic pain i want to see if there are official guidelines especially in the netherlands
Assistant: there are a few published discussions in some dutch medical journals regarding off-label cannabis use for pain management during pregnancy but the data is still limited and inconclusive overall you might find some research notes from the nederlandse vereniging voor obstetrie en gynaecologie but they have not released definitive guidelines on this
User: i have a pregnant patient with severe neuropathic pain all her labs and maternal checks look fine but im reading conflicting studies about off-label cannabis use is it safe to prescribe in this situation or do we have solid evidence
