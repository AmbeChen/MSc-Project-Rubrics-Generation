User: Write an interaction note about my 45-year-old friend who slipped slightly on the steps at home. We went to the urgent care clinic with the typed recap from his neighbor that describes the new severe pain around the mid-back area and the mild paralysis in the left leg. My friend has a known history of osteoporosis. The neighbor's note also indicates stable vital signs: heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 132/85, no shortness of breath. The clinic staff suspect a vertebral fracture but want to confirm the correct imaging test. Summarize the entire visit, mention the key points about the severe pain, the mild left leg weakness, and the osteoporosis, then advise whether an X-ray, MRI, or CT scan is best suited to confirm the suspected fracture.
