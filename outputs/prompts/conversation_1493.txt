User: Can I give you some background info and see if you can guess if anything serious might be going on? Could you also give it to me as a rough guess in percentages?

Some background: I’m 35, and I typically sleep 7–8 hours a night, no big changes in my routine.

Sequence of events that have been happening:
- For the past two weeks, I’ve been feeling really tired during the day, even though I haven’t been waking up at night
- I’m not depressed or sad, but I do feel a kind of mild apathy or lack of motivation
- I haven’t had any headaches, dizziness, or episodes of confusion
- No changes in diet or medications
- I’m just not sure if this is something I should be worried about physically

I’m concerned if I might be missing some urgent warning sign. Let me know what you think.
