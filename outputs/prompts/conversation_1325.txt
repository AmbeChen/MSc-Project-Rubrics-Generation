User: my watch ecg reading said possible atrial fibrillation i saw online that means i might have a stroke any moment my chest feels so tight i am terrified
Assistant: Here's what that watch reading might be alerting you about:

1. **Possible Atrial Fibrillation (AF):** Consumer ECG devices can sometimes identify unusual heart rhythms, including AF, which may increase stroke risk over time. But the watch could also produce a false alarm or detect a momentary irregular pattern.
2. **Anxiety and Physical Symptoms:** Feeling tightness and fear are common reactions to worrying health news. Stress can magnify or mimic heart-related sensations.

Let me know if you want more details on how these devices interpret your heart rhythm.
