User: rewrite this message: "My 10-year-old daughter, Maria, started amoxicillin 500 mg twice daily for a sinus infection 5 days ago. There's partial improvement, but she still has nasal congestion. Should we continue the same antibiotic, or switch medications? Also, how long does it typically take to notice improvement, and when do we need to re-check?"

I think we should clarify that sinus infections can take 7-10 days for noticeable improvement, emphasize continuing the antibiotic for a full 10-day course (5 more days left), mention we only recommend a re-check if fever returns or symptoms worsen or fail to improve within another 2-3 days. I'd also remove any mention of sedation side effects. Please incorporate those changes.
