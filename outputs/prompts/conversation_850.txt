User: which post-exposure hiv prophylaxis is recommended if i had a possible exposure last weekend? i saw some standard combos mentioned: *TDF+FTC+Raltegravir* or *TDF+3TC+Dolutegravir*. i’m 35, female, no chronic conditions, but i’m not sure what’s available where i live or how to get it. which pep do i go with?
