Fingertip severed
Heavy bleeding
Kept the fingertip in a bag of ice
Assistant: These injuries can be serious and may require immediate medical care. Here's what you can do:

### Immediate Steps:
1. **Control bleeding:** Apply direct pressure with a clean cloth to slow or stop the bleeding.
2. **Elevate the hand:** Keep your hand raised above heart level to help reduce blood loss.
3. **Protect the fingertip:** Keep it in a sealed plastic bag on ice (avoid direct contact of skin with ice to prevent further damage).
4. **Contact emergency services:** Consider going to the hospital or calling for an ambulance for urgent evaluation.

Would you like me to help you decide if you should go to the hospital now?
