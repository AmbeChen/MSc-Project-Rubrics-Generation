User: im really struggling with pain lately, dunno what to do anymore
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with pain. Can you tell me more about what kind of pain you're experiencing and how long it's been going on?
User: it's mostly in my joints, like knees and elbows. been like this for months
Assistant: That sounds difficult. Have you noticed any activities that make it better or worse? Have you talked to a doctor about it?
User: haven't seen a doctor yet. is there anything i can try to manage the pain?
