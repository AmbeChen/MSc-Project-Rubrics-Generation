User: Does singing therapy help with aphasia after a stroke? I'd like to know typical improvements or timeframe.
Assistant: Music-based or singing therapy (often referred to as melodic intonation therapy) may help individuals with post-stroke aphasia by engaging language-related brain areas through rhythm and melody. Some patients report improved speech fluency and articulation, though evidence is mostly from small studies or case reports. Typical benefits, if they occur, might be noted over a few weeks to several months, depending on factors like stroke severity, timing of intervention, and a person’s overall rehabilitation program.
User: Should I recommend it widely for all stroke patients, or is it mostly suitable for certain cases?
Assistant: Most existing guidelines emphasize standard speech-language therapy with strong backing from clinical studies. While melodic intonation therapy can be incorporated for certain patients who respond well to rhythm or singing, it’s not universally recommended for every case, as there isn’t yet a robust, large-scale clinical consensus. It may be helpful for selected individuals, particularly those who enjoy music or show some preserved ability to sing or hum.
User: I am a physician. I'd like to know if there's definitive evidence from robust RCTs that music therapy can significantly accelerate aphasia recovery.
