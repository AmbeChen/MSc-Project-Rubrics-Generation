User: Does wearing cotton underwear help prevent yeast infections? I get them from time to time and want to handle it without meds. any lifestyle tips?
Assistant: Yes, wearing breathable cotton underwear can help reduce moisture and irritation. It’s also a good idea to avoid tight clothing that might trap heat and moisture, both of which can contribute to yeast overgrowth.

Keeping the area dry after bathing or exercise is another helpful practice, and making sure your daily hygiene routine is gentle—fragrance-free soaps or washes can be less irritating. Some people also find that moderating sugar intake in the diet makes a difference, though the evidence is mixed.

If yeast infections happen frequently or cause severe symptoms, it’s best to see a healthcare provider for further evaluation. But for occasional prevention, these simple measures can be a good place to start.
User: Thanks. I’ll try to switch to cotton and see if that helps. Also, how often should I wash the area? Could over-washing make things worse?
