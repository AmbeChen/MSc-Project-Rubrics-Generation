User: how many servings of fruit and vegetables recommended daily for healthy adult
Assistant: For a healthy adult, mainstream nutrition guidelines often recommend about five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Number of Servings**: Generally, 5 total servings daily (e.g., 2 servings of fruit + 3 servings of vegetables) is widely accepted.
- **Serving Size**: Each serving is typically around 80 g or 1 cup of raw leafy greens.
- **Variety**: Mixing different colors and types ensures a range of nutrients (e.g., leafy greens, berries, carrots).

Making fruits and vegetables a central part of your diet can support heart health, digestive function, and overall wellness.
