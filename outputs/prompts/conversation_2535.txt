User: Extended psychiatric e/m coding guidelines
Assistant: E/M coding for psychiatric evaluations typically follows **Evaluation and Management** guidelines outlined by the AMA. Here’s an overview:

---

### 1. **Code Selection Factors**
   - **Patient Type**: New vs. established
   - **Complexity of Care**: Includes history, exam, and medical decision-making
   - **Time Spent**: Important for higher-level codes, especially extended sessions

---

### 2. **Common CPT Codes**
   - **99204** (New Patient, moderate to high complexity)
   - **99205** (New Patient, high complexity)
   - **99214** (Established Patient, moderate complexity)
   - **99215** (Established Patient, high complexity)

---

### 3. **Psychiatric-Specific Considerations**
   - Psychiatric add-on codes can be used for psychotherapy services alongside E/M codes.
   - Documentation must detail symptoms, diagnosis, mental status exam, and medical decision-making.

---

### 4. **Extended Session Guidelines**
   - For encounters exceeding typical appointment durations (e.g., > 60 minutes), ensure time-based coding aligns with current AMA standards.
   - Include start/stop times or total time in the record, especially for prolonged services.

---

### Notes
   - Always consult the latest **CPT manual** and local payer policies. Document thoroughly to reflect the complexity of the visit.
User: E/M code times for 60+ min eval
Assistant: Extended E/M sessions that run 60+ minutes can involve **prolonged service codes** in addition to the base E/M code. Below is a simplified outline:

---

### 1. **Base E/M Code**
   - Select the appropriate E/M code (e.g., 99205 for a new patient) that matches the complexity and time up to the highest typical duration (often 45–59 minutes).

---

### 2. **Prolonged Services**
   - Use an add-on code (e.g., **+99417** for each additional 15 minutes beyond the standard E/M)
   - Ensure documentation includes exact **start and end times** or total time.

---

### 3. **Documentation Essentials**
   - Chief complaint, relevant history, exam details, and clinical decision-making
   - Justification for extended time (e.g., patient complexity, coordination with other providers)

---

### Important
   - Confirm your payer’s rules. While AMA guidelines are standard, some insurers might have variations or require additional modifiers.
