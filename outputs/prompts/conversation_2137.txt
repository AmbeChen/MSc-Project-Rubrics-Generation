User: can you help treat motion sickness?
Assistant: I'd be happy to try and help. Please share a bit more about when you typically experience your motion sickness or any other details that might be relevant, and I'll see what I can suggest. Keep in mind that I'm not a medical professional, so my guidance should not replace visiting a healthcare provider.
User: I get nauseous anytime I travel, whether it's by car, bus, or plane. It's really uncomfortable. I'd like to know what medication would work best and how much I should take, but I'm not sure where to start.
