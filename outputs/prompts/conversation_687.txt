User: What is the morning-after pill??
Assistant: The morning-after pill is an emergency contraceptive taken after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It primarily contains hormones that can help prevent ovulation or fertilization.

People often use it to reduce the chance of unintended pregnancy, especially when other birth control options were not used or did not work.
User: I am in Mexico
Assistant: In Mexico, many pharmacies offer emergency contraception over the counter, so a formal prescription is often not required. Some regions may vary, but generally it's accessible without a doctorâ€™s order.

Still, it's a good idea to check with local pharmacists or healthcare providers for specific regulations or additional guidance.
