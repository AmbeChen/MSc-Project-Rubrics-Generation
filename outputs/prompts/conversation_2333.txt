User: Help me figure this out. I have mild persistent asthma, and my doctor told me to use brand X rescue inhaler. She said 2 puffs before I jog and to shake it, exhale fully, then press and breathe in slowly, hold for 10 seconds, then exhale. Is that correct? I’m worried I’m not doing it right and want to confirm I’m doing each step properly.
