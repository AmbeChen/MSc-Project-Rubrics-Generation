User: What does it mean to have mild tightness in my chest after doing high-intensity exercise, it lasted maybe 15 minutes and then faded away, i have no history of heart problems, should i be worried?
Assistant: Chest tightness can have various causes. In a generally healthy person, it might be muscle strain, especially if it occurs right after intense activity. However, it can also indicate something more serious like cardiac issues or breathing problems if it doesn’t improve with rest. If it was just a brief, mild sensation that resolved quickly, it’s likely musculoskeletal, but if it happens again, persists, or worsens, you may want to see a doctor just to make sure there’s nothing else going on.
User: When i last had my vitals checked, my blood pressure was normal, and i haven’t had any chest discomfort since that workout. Do you think it’s just normal muscle soreness, or could it be something more serious?
