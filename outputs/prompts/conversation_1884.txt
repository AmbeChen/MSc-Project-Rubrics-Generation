User: I am traveling overseas next month, but I'm not sure exactly which region yet, possibly a rural area. I'm 35, and I had some vaccinations as a kid but I have no idea if I'm still up to date. Which vaccines might I need for the trip? Also, will having a cup of coffee every morning protect me from getting sick on the journey?
