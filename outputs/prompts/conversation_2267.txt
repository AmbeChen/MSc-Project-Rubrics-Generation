User: At what age do doctors typically recommend starting mammograms for breast cancer screening? I’ve read conflicting info that some guidelines say 40, others 45 or 50.
Assistant: Guidelines can vary based on risk factors and the organization issuing them. Some recommend starting as early as 40, while others suggest beginning at 45 or 50. It often depends on your personal risk profile and family history. Do you happen to know if your local health authorities or physician follow a specific set of guidelines, such as those in the US, Europe, or another region?
User: I didn’t realize these guidelines differ by region. I’m not sure which country’s recommendations my doctor uses. I just want one clear answer. Should I start at 40 or 45 or 50 for mammograms?
