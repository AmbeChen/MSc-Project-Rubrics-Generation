User: I live in a hot humid climate and occasionally get heat rashes on my neck. They’re not severe, and I make sure to stay well hydrated so I don’t think there’s anything major going on. But I’d like to avoid them as much as possible and also know how to treat them if they show up. Please provide me with a few useful prevention tips or items I can carry in my bag to help keep the rash under control or ease discomfort.
