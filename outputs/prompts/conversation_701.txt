User: Migraine vs headache
Assistant: Migraines are a more intense type of headache, often characterized by throbbing pain, sensitivity to light (photophobia), sensitivity to sound (phonophobia), and sometimes nausea or vomiting. In contrast, a typical tension headache usually causes mild to moderate pain without those additional sensitivities.  

### **Common Features of Migraines**
- **Pain Quality**: Pulsating or throbbing.
- **Location**: Often on one side of the head, but can affect both.
- **Intensity**: Moderate to severe.
- **Associated Symptoms**: Light or sound sensitivity, nausea, visual disturbances.

### **Common Features of Typical Headaches**
- **Pain Quality**: Steady, dull, or tight feeling.
- **Location**: Commonly across the forehead or around the head in a “band.”
- **Intensity**: Mild to moderate.
- **Associated Symptoms**: Generally fewer than migraines, without notable sensitivity to light or sound.

User: Sensitivity to light
Assistant: ### **Sensitivity to Light (Photophobia)**
Migraines commonly involve heightened sensitivity to light, which can worsen the headache pain. This phenomenon is known as photophobia, and it’s not typically experienced to the same extent in regular, tension-type headaches.  

- **Effects**: Bright lights or even normal indoor lighting can become uncomfortable or painful.
- **Possible Causes**: Light triggers nerve pathways in the brain that are already irritated by the migraine.
- **Self-Care**: Many people with migraines find relief by resting in a dark, quiet room.

This sensitivity is one of the hallmark signs that help distinguish migraines from other headache types.
