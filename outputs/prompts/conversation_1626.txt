User: What do you think is going on with me? My face randomly feels hot and flushed multiple times a day. Should I be worried, or is it just normal?
Assistant: As per general medical knowledge, changes in facial temperature can have various causes, such as hormonal fluctuations, mild anxiety, or changes in blood flow. However, diagnosing requires a professional evaluation. If accompanied by additional symptoms like persistent fever, difficulty breathing, or dizziness, it might indicate a more serious condition. Without details on how severe or sudden these episodes are, it's not possible to be certain.
User: Yes, I want to write a message to my boss explaining why I avoid in-person meetings. Some friends said it could be an emergency issue with my thyroid or something serious. I'm worried. Summarize a short text that conveys this, and tell me if I need to rush to a doctor soon.
Assistant: Here’s a concise message you could send:

"Boss, I'm experiencing frequent hot flushes on my face and feel quite self-conscious about it. I’d prefer to avoid in-person interactions until I figure out what’s going on. I appreciate your understanding."

While it could be related to stress or hormonal factors, I don’t have enough information to confirm its urgency. If these hot flushes become more frequent, severe, or come with other worrying symptoms, consider contacting a healthcare provider.
User: It happened four times today alone, and my face felt like it was on fire, no idea if it's a big warning sign or a minor thing. Should I go to the ER or is this just some harmless condition?
