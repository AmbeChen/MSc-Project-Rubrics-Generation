User: Compare dryness from reading physical books and dryness from working on a computer for me
Assistant: Dry eye sensations can arise in both situations, but using digital screens often leads to more frequent dryness because of reduced blinking and prolonged focus. Here is a short comparison:

1. **Blink Rate**
   - **Reading Physical Books**: When reading, you generally maintain a steadier blink rate, though it can still decrease if you’re deeply focused.
   - **Using a Computer**: Screen-based activities often reduce your blink rate further, partially due to the visual demand and glare.

2. **Screen Glare & Brightness**
   - **Physical Books**: Glare can be an issue under direct light, but it’s often easier to control by adjusting the book’s position or lighting.
   - **Computer Screens**: The constant light source and glare from monitors can contribute to eye fatigue, which may exacerbate dryness.

3. **Viewing Distance**
   - **Physical Books**: Typically read at a comfortable arm’s length, which can reduce strain.
   - **Computer Screens**: Viewing distance may be longer, and the eyes might be working harder to focus on pixels.

4. **Body Position**
   - **Physical Books**: You might shift your posture more often while reading a book, possibly putting less continuous strain on certain eye muscles.
   - **Computer Screens**: People often sit in a fixed posture for extended periods, which can lead to less blinking and an increase in dryness.

5. **Environmental Factors**
   - **Physical Books**: Reading is more flexible with lighting; you can easily step away or take breaks.
   - **Computer Screens**: Work environments may have air conditioning or heating that affects humidity around your workspace.

Overall, both activities can cause dryness if done for extended periods without breaks. However, prolonged computer use often intensifies dryness due to reduced blinking and constant exposure to a lit screen.
User: give me best tips for dryness from extended screen time. don't give me cliche advice. I'm 35 with no medical issues, want recognized standard approaches
