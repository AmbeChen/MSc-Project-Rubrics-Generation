User: Hi Mam,
I keep getting strep throat again and again. My doctor did a thorough checkup and said antibiotics are fine but didn’t really suggest anything else for long-term prevention. Now I want to try taking colloidal silver every day to keep strep from coming back. I’ve read mixed things online and I don’t know if there’s good proof it works or if it’s safe in the long run. I’m a vegetarian, but I do eat eggs and a bit of dairy for protein. I’m really fed up with strep, so please let me know your thoughts. How can I contact you.
