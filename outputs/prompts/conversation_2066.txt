Hello! I've read the official AUA guidelines about mid-urethral sling for stress urinary incontinence. I'd like to ensure we mention normal bladder compliance is required and that an active urinary tract infection is a major contraindication. Let me know if you want me to revise anything else.
Assistant: Sure, here's a revised version of your text:

Hello!

I've reviewed the official AUA guidelines regarding mid-urethral sling placement for stress urinary incontinence. It’s important to note that normal bladder compliance is recommended, and an active urinary tract infection is considered a major contraindication. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to address.

We can proceed if the UTI is cleared. She also doesn't have a known neurological disease, so that is good. Let me know if there's any other recommended step for her.

If the UTI has resolved, it may now be appropriate to proceed. She also does not have any known neurological disease, which is another positive factor. Let me know if there are any additional steps or considerations you’d like to include.

I also want to highlight in the next note that normal bladder compliance is essential and an active infection is a strong contraindication for mid-urethral sling placement. Let me know if there are any other important contraindications we should mention. Thank you
