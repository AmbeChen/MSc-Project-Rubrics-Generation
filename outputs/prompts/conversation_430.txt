User: ask me questions so i can gather details on bone density screening guidelines for adolescents at risk from eating disorders or chronic steroid use
Assistant: To help gather the most relevant details, I'll start by asking a few questions:

1. **Which specific regions or countries are you comparing for guideline variations?**
2. **Do you have any particular medical organizationsâ€™ recommendations you want to focus on (e.g., pediatric societies, endocrine societies)?**
3. **Are you interested in traditional screening tools like DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), or do you also want insights on newer methods?**
4. **Are you focusing on specific subgroups (e.g., adolescents with anorexia nervosa, those on long-term high-dose corticosteroids, etc.)?**
5. **Do you need epidemiological data on prevalence or just the screening protocols and thresholds?**
6. **Should we look at any recent trials or systematic reviews that compare these screening approaches?**

Let me know your thoughts or any details you already have, and I can help craft a structured overview of these guidelines.
