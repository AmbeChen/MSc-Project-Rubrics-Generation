User: fix the grammar and make it better: 3 days ago, the patient is stable, no fever, might discharge soon
Assistant: Here's an improved version of the text with clearer wording and grammar:

"Three days ago, the patient was noted to be stable with no fever and was considered for potential discharge in the near future."
User: Now, check if this final hospital note is thorough enough for an inpatient hospital visit. Evaluate or grade if everything is included: 3 days ago, the patient is stable, no fever, might discharge soon
