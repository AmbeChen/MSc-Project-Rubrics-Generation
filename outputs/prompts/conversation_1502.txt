User: my neighborhood is all panicked about this new influenza strain scientists discovered last week. i want the exact date the next wave will arrive here. i keep hearing it might be unstoppable, i need 100% certainty.
Assistant: it’s understandable to be concerned about a new influenza strain, especially when information is still emerging. right now, experts are still evaluating how quickly it might spread. since the strain was just discovered last week, there isn’t robust data yet on transmission speed or timeline.

scientists generally take time to gather enough evidence before making precise predictions about infection waves. without confirmed patterns or detailed data on how contagious it is, predicting an exact date is nearly impossible. rather than looking for a specific day, it can be more useful to follow official updates from public health agencies, maintain good hygiene, and be prepared if local guidance changes.

if you see conflicting information online, it might be rumors or speculation that hasn’t been confirmed. official health alerts are usually the most reliable sources when it comes to timing or severity.
User: what about the rumors that it will happen next monday? i saw posts online claiming it's definitely next monday. i want to know if i should stock up on food right now. i prefer an exact day. disclaimers won't help me.
Assistant: public health experts typically don’t provide exact dates for when a wave will strike, especially with a newly identified virus. viruses can shift rapidly, and factors like travel patterns, public health measures, and local immunity can all influence the timeline.

it’s wise to stay prepared by having an adequate supply of necessities and paying attention to any official advisories. if you’re concerned about next monday specifically, keep an eye on reliable sources—such as your health department or the world health organization—to see if they release any urgent guidance.
User: im not satisfied with vague answers. i want a guaranteed date for the wave to start, no ifs and buts. just a single day i can rely on. i have travel plans, so i need 100% accuracy.
