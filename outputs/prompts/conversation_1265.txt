User: Based on the below observations about antibiotic usage in my region, suggest prophylactic antibiotic for my upcoming tooth extraction:

1) I'm traveling in Region X in South America
2) Local guidelines mention high prevalence of penicillin-resistant bacteria
3) Some local health authorities suggest a different antibiotic, but I'm not sure
4) It's a standard dental extraction
5) I'm male, 28
6) I have no known allergies
7) I'm planning to start prophylaxis a day before the procedure
8) I can't access a local dentist easily because I'm in a rural area
9) I've heard conflicting advice from different clinics
10) I'm worried about side effects from broad-spectrum antibiotics

What antibiotic, dose, and schedule is recommended?
