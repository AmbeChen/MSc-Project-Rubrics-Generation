User: lump near my left breast, terrified i can't sleep, so worried it's cancer
Assistant: Breast lumps can be caused by many things, and not all lumps mean cancer. Let’s talk about what might be going on and what steps to consider:

1. **Possible Causes**: There are benign (non-cancerous) causes of breast lumps, such as cysts or fibrocystic changes, which can feel lumpy or tender. Sometimes lumps can appear because of simple hormonal fluctuations.
2. **Next Steps**: Even though it’s scary, seeing a qualified medical professional is important. A doctor can examine the lump, possibly order imaging (like an ultrasound or mammogram), and guide you on the appropriate tests.
3. **Self-Checks**: Try to remember if you’ve had lumps or pain before. Look for changes in the skin, nipple discharge, or differences in how each breast feels.
4. **Seeking Support**: It’s normal to feel anxiety and lose sleep over this. Talking to someone you trust, like a close friend or family member, can help. If you’re feeling extremely distressed, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support.
5. **Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed**: While searching online for answers can be tempting, it can also raise fears. It’s better to connect with a healthcare provider you trust to get personalized advice.

You’re not alone in feeling afraid—lots of people go through this worry when they find a lump. Take a deep breath and remember that many lumps turn out to be manageable or harmless. Scheduling that doctor’s visit is a solid, proactive step.
