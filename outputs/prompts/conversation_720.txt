User: i have a slow healing wound and i’m at a small rural clinic that only has one broad-spectrum antibiotic pill. can you pretend like you’re my doc and explain if this pill is enough for my infection or if i need IV meds, what signs to watch for, and what questions you have for me so we know what’s next?
