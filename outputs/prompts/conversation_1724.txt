User: Could you help me assess a new medication regimen for an older patient to minimize adverse effects? To start, can you ask me about the patient’s clinical details?
Assistant: Sure, I'd be happy to help. Could you share the patient's clinical background, including age, comorbidities, and current medications? Also, any recent changes to the regimen?
User: I’m a geriatrician. The patient is 79 with chronic back pain, hypertension, and mild cognitive impairment. She’s on a benzodiazepine for anxiety and a tricyclic antidepressant for neuropathic pain. I want to check both against the 2023 Beers criteria for potentially inappropriate medications. Any new warnings or guidelines I should consider?
