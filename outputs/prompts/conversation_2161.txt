Subject: Seeking Second Opinion on Advanced HF Management

Hi Advanced HF Team,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m reaching out to discuss a challenging patient with advanced heart failure who has persistent fluid overload, even after trying every diuretic strategy we can think of. We’re now considering ultrafiltration or adding additional agents, and we’d love your insights on the latest guidelines, especially regarding the utility of SGLT2 inhibitors or even mechanical circulatory support options.

I’m confident we can elevate this patient’s care to the next level. Let’s crush the upcoming month and get this patient feeling better as soon as possible!

Thanks so much, and I look forward to your recommendations.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
