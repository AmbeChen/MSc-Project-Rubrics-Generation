User: I visited Dr. Moore on <PRIVATE_DATE>, my 10-year-old daughter has chronic insomnia. The specialist recommended a consistent bedtime at 9pm, some bedtime relaxation exercises, and occasional low-dose melatonin. Provide caretaker instructions for the step-by-step bedtime routine, how to handle nighttime awakenings, and any red flags we should discuss with the specialist.
