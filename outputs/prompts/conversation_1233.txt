User: I have a new patient with primary hyperparathyroidism, I'm an endocrine surgeon so I'd like to confirm the recommended approach
Assistant: I’d be happy to help you think through the guidelines for surgery! Just let me know the labs, imaging, or other details you’re using to make your plan, and we can review them.
User: The patient’s serum calcium is 11.2 mg/dL, PTH is 90 pg/mL, T-score on the bone density scan is -2.6, I’m thinking a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is indicated. I plan to finalize everything in the hospital’s surgical record, including sedation vs general anesthesia. Are we within the standard guidelines for resection?
