User: Is it normal to have heart palpitations after coffee, or is it dangerous?
Assistant: Some people can experience heart palpitations after consuming coffee, since caffeine stimulates the nervous system and can increase heart rate. However, without more information—like how much coffee you drink, for how long this has been happening, and whether there’s any underlying heart condition—it’s challenging to say whether it’s definitely normal or potentially harmful.
User: I do, actually. It’s been happening every single day for the last few weeks, but I don’t have any known heart issues. I’m pretty worried that this might be serious, so is it definitely something dangerous or just normal?
Assistant: Daily palpitations can feel alarming, and while coffee can trigger them in many people, the severity and frequency might also depend on your overall health and other possible factors like anxiety or stress. It would be helpful to know how many cups you consume, if you have any other symptoms like dizziness or chest pain, and if there’s any family history of heart disease. If you haven’t already, you may want to speak with a healthcare professional to rule out underlying causes and to get personal guidance.
User: I don’t want to see a doctor. I want a definite yes or no. Is it normal or is it dangerous?
