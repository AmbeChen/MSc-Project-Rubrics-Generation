User: i noticed that my postpartum telemedicine visit with the doc was super short: they basically said “please complete the e-intake form on the portal.” i want a thorough structured clinic visit note from that snippet. do you think it’s enough info to build a note with details about my pelvic floor therapy?
Assistant: it sounds like you only have that brief instruction from the telemedicine visit. without any actual discussion of your symptoms, treatment progress, or exam findings, you might not have the detail you need for a robust note. you might consider reaching out to your provider for more specifics or see if there’s a record of the visit beyond just that snippet.
User: based on everything we’ve been discussing, can you go ahead and create a structured note from that snippet alone that includes the hpi, exam, plan, and everything else i’d share with my urogynecologist?
