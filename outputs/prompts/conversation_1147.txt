User: so random question i'm a nurse practitioner and i have this new patient with newly diagnosed hypertension right and i'm super pressed for time so i was thinking i'd try to get a quick soap note put together for them basically so i have the data from their visit their bp was 156 over 90 in the right arm measured a couple times they're complaining of mild headaches but no dizziness or chest pain heart rate is around 78 and the physical exam was pretty normal no edema or weird heart sounds they do have a family history of htn so i'm guessing it's essential hypertension but i still want to document all this anyway i plan to recommend some lifestyle modifications maybe start a low dose diuretic but i don't want a massive write up just a concise subjective objective assessment and plan so i can move on to my next patient cause my schedule's really busy right now
