User: Pre-participation exam template for an adolescent athlete. I’m a sports medicine physician. I’d like to detail the musculoskeletal exam findings, normal vital sign ranges, and mention relevant sports guidelines.
Assistant: A typical **pre-participation exam (PPE)** for adolescent athletes includes multiple components. Here is a concise outline:

---

**1. Medical History**
- Personal and family history of cardiac conditions
- Previous injuries and surgeries
- Concussion or head injury history
- Current medications and supplements

---

**2. Vital Signs**
- **Heart Rate**: Normal resting range can be ~60–100 bpm; adolescent athletes may be at the lower end.
- **Blood Pressure**: Normal systolic ~90–120 mmHg, diastolic ~60–80 mmHg; vary by age/height percentile.
- **Respiratory Rate**: Typically 12–20 breaths/min

---

**3. Musculoskeletal Exam**
- **Postural & Alignment Check**: Assess for scoliosis, leg length discrepancies
- **Joint Inspection & Range of Motion**: Evaluate neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles
- **Strength & Flexibility Testing**: Focus on major muscle groups and any previous injury sites
- **Functional Screening**: Single-leg squats, hop tests, or sport-specific maneuvers

---

**4. Cardiovascular & Pulmonary Assessment**
- Auscultation for murmurs
- Exercise tolerance if indicated

---

**5. Sports-Specific Guidance**
- Follow recognized guidelines (e.g., **American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)** or **National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)** recommendations)
- Screen for risk factors such as overuse injuries
