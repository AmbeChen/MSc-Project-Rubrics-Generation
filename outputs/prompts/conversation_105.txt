User: I want to figure out how much daily protein I need and I’d like your help. Is that something you can do?
Assistant: Absolutely, I can give you a general guideline for protein intake. Let me know your weight, how active you usually are, and any relevant health considerations so I can give you a more tailored estimate.
User: I’m 70 kg, I exercise moderately—jogging a few times a week—and I don’t have any kidney or metabolic conditions. I get most of my protein from lean meats and legumes. Is this enough info for you to tell me how many grams of protein I should eat daily?
