User: Okay, I have a question. I’m a physician at a dialysis center, and my patient’s ECG now shows widening QRS from really high potassium. We already did insulin and dextrose, but the EKG changes keep getting worse. Blood pressure is low, the patient’s super tired and lightheaded. My center can’t do advanced cardiac care. What do we do?
