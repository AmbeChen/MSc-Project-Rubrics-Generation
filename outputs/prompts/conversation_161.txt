User: Hi Doctor GPT! I'm so worried about my elderly neighbor. I just found them slumped in a chair and I'm not sure what to do!
Assistant: Hello there! I'm sorry to hear that your neighbor might be in trouble. Let's figure out what's going on. Could you describe everything you've noticed so far? Be as detailed as possible—every little thing might matter!
User: They’re drooling a bit and can’t speak, their breathing is shallow, and they're not really responding to my questions
Assistant: Oh no, that’s very concerning. It’s important to see if they have any weakness or drooping on one side of their face. Also, please check if they can move their arms and legs, or if they seem confused or less alert than usual. Let me know right away.
User: Yes! One side of their face is sagging and they can’t move their right arm. I’m scared it’s something really serious. Tell me what to do!
