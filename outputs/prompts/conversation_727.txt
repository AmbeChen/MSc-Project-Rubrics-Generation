User: Hey Dr. Alvarez, I discussed with Dr. Kim; we appreciate the references to Listeriosis in pregnancy and I understand your vantage. At this stage we would like to work on that structured abstract we talked about, focusing on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes, plus recommended antibiotic regimens and the follow-up guidelines. We also want to integrate the single-center retrospective study results that we mentioned previously. After our initial overview, we said we’d aim to finalize everything by the end of this week unless something special comes up. I’d suggest we speak on Friday; I believe that gives us enough time to wrap up the abstract properly.
