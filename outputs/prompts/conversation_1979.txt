User: reword in more simple terms and make it more direct: Considering all factors, for a 45-year old male with elevated AST and ALT but no notable symptoms beyond mild obesity and no known alcohol abuse, one approach is to begin by testing for viral hepatitis such as Hepatitis B or C. However, we also have the option to proceed with imaging studies, typically an abdominal ultrasound, to evaluate for possible fatty liver disease or other structural problems. It's crucial to decide which route to pursue first or whether both should be done at the same time, taking into account cost, patient convenience, and current guidelines.
