User: Age 35 female neck stiffness after sitting at the computer 10 hours daily occasional headaches no fever no confusion no trouble walking or focusing shoulders feel tense worried if it’s an infection or just posture
Assistant: I’m sorry to hear about your discomfort. Let’s go through possible reasons and suggestions, but please keep in mind this isn’t a substitute for an in-person evaluation.

### Potential Causes
1. **Muscle Tension or Strain**
   - Sitting for extended periods with poor posture can cause neck stiffness and headaches.
   - Repetitive stress injuries may lead to chronic stiffness over time.
2. **Tension Headaches**
   - Often triggered by stress, muscle tension, or prolonged screen time.
3. **Other Causes**
   - Without fever or confusion, serious infection is less likely, but it’s important to track whether you develop additional symptoms.

### Suggestions
- **Posture Adjustments:** Ensure your workstation is ergonomic; keep your monitor at eye level, take breaks to stretch.
- **Lifestyle:** Stay hydrated, consider light stretching or yoga for neck and shoulder relief.
- **Headache Diary:** Note frequency and severity to see if there’s a pattern (e.g., stress, specific times).
- **Medical Evaluation:** If the stiffness or headaches worsen or you develop fever or other neurological signs (e.g., confusion, severe neck pain, or persistent vomiting), see a doctor.
