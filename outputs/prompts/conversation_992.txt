User: Is it common to run a drug interaction check when transitioning between antidepressants
Assistant: Medication interaction checks are indeed common when switching from one antidepressant to another, especially if the patient is taking additional medications or supplements. This helps ensure safety and tolerability during transitions and reduces the risk of harmful side effects. If you have concerns about interactions, it can be helpful to provide all medication details and dosing information to the healthcare professional so they can assess any possible risks.
User: I have a patient transitioning from sertraline 50 mg daily to venlafaxine XR 75 mg daily. They also take diphenhydramine 25 mg at bedtime for insomnia. Are there any interaction concerns or dosage issues to watch out for
