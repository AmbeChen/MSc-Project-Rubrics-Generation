Assistant: Based on the symptoms of **mild heartburn and chest discomfort** that occur after a spicy meal and improve by morning, the following measures can be considered:

1. Avoid lying down immediately after eating; wait at least 2-3 hours before going to bed.  
2. Slightly **elevate the head** of your bed to minimize acid reflux during sleep.  
3. Over-the-counter **antacids** (like calcium carbonate) may provide quick relief.  
4. Reduce or avoid very spicy or fatty foods if they often trigger heartburn.  
5. Sipping warm water or herbal teas can sometimes soothe mild irritation.

If these steps donâ€™t help or symptoms worsen, please consult a healthcare provider.
