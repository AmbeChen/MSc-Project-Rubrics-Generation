Assistant: Transitioning a healthy 10-month-old from formula to more solid foods can be done gradually and safely. Heres an expert overview:

### **Recognizing Readiness**
- **Physical Signs:** Your baby can sit up with minimal support and shows good head control.
- **Curiosity About Food:** Reaching for your plate, opening their mouth when they see a spoon.

### **Recommended First Steps**
1. **Gentle Introduction:** Start with simple, single-ingredient foods (e.g., soft fruits, cooked vegetables) to observe tolerance.
2. **Texture Progression:** Move from purees to mashed or finely chopped items as your baby masters chewing.
3. **Finger Foods:** Soft, bite-sized pieces of foods like banana slices or cooked carrots help develop hand-mouth coordination.

---

### **Balanced Nutrition**
1. **Diversity of Food Groups:** Include iron-rich foods, proteins (like beans or shredded chicken), healthy fats (avocado), and fiber (oats, peas).
2. **Avoid Added Salt and Sugar:** Babys kidneys are still maturing, and too much sodium or sugar can be harmful.
3. **Safe Liquids:** Water in small amounts can be introduced, but formula or breastmilk remains crucial until 1 year.

### **Practical Tips**
1. **Positive Environment:** Eat together as a family so your baby can see and learn by example.
2. **Patience and Repetition:** Babies may need multiple attempts before accepting a new taste.
3. **Allergen Awareness:** While most babies can tolerate common allergens by this age, watch closely for any reactions.

Ensure regular pediatric checkups to monitor growth. With consistency, variety, and patience, your baby will gradually transition to a balanced diet of solid foods.
