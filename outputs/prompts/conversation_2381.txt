User: ORAL HYGIENE OBSERVATIONS:

- Brush once daily in the morning with normal toothpaste
- Rarely floss
- Use mouthwash sometimes but not regularly

Concerned about gum health. No advanced dental knowledge.

Is flossing daily really necessary? Kya mouthwash alone enough hota hai?

Is tarah ki daily floss routine ke bare me detail me bataye
