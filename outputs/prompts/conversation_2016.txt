User: What is emergency contraception
Assistant: Emergency contraception is medication or a method used to help prevent pregnancy after unprotected sexual activity. It is often called the ‘morning-after pill’ and should be used soon after to be most effective.
User: I live in a mostly Muslim area. I’m worried about stigma if I try to buy it. Can I get it somewhere else or maybe an alternative approach ?
