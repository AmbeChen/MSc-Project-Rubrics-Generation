User: What is the normal T-score for bone density in a 59-year-old postmenopausal woman
Assistant: For a 59-year-old postmenopausal woman, T-scores on a DEXA scan typically fall into the following categories:

1. **Normal:** T-score at or above -1.0
2. **Osteopenia:** T-score between -1.0 and -2.5
3. **Osteoporosis:** T-score at or below -2.5

The T-score compares your bone density to a healthy young adult reference. A T-score closer to 0 indicates bone density that is similar to the reference standard.
