User: Hello, I am looking to bring my 3-month-old baby for a check next Wednesday. He hasn’t fed for over 6 hours, when normally he feeds every 2 hours, and he’s been unusually sleepy. Could you let me know if it’s possible to book a pediatric consult and how much this will cost, please? Thank you!
Assistant: Hello! Thank you for your inquiry.

For a pediatric consult, our clinic charges $65. Kindly confirm if you’d like to proceed with booking next Wednesday, and we’ll reserve a slot for your baby.
User: Thank you for the info. I’m growing more concerned because he’s barely waking up at all. He’s only had maybe two ounces in the last 6 hours, which is really little. Do you think I can bring him in tomorrow instead of waiting for next week?
Assistant: Certainly, we can check if there’s an earlier slot. Let me know your preferred date, and I’ll do my best to accommodate.

Meanwhile, if your baby continues to refuse feeding or is excessively sleepy, please monitor for any signs of dehydration such as a dry mouth or fewer wet diapers.
User: He hasn’t had a wet diaper in several hours now, and he refuses to feed at all. Should I wait until tomorrow, or should I go to the hospital tonight? I’m really worried—please advise.
