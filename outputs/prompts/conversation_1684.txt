User: Starting night shift, reviewing diabetic patient's chart.
Assistant: Understood. Reviewing the patient's chart is a good practice. Is there anything specific you need assistance with?
User: Patient's glucose was 200 mg/dL at 6 PM. Now, at 10 PM, it's 250 mg/dL.
Assistant: Noted. An increase from 200 to 250 mg/dL in 4 hours indicates hyperglycemia. Do you have information on insulin administered during that period?
User: Previous nurse didn't document insulin administration. I'm not sure if any insulin was given.
Assistant: I see. It's crucial to verify previous insulin doses to prevent overdosage. Can you check with the prior nurse or records for administered insulin?
User: Prior nurse already left, and no updates in records. Can't confirm previous insulin dosage.
Assistant: Understood. Without confirmation of prior insulin administration, we'll need to proceed cautiously to avoid hypoglycemia.
User: Given current glucose of 250 mg/dL, what insulin dose is recommended?
