User: My friend fell from the second floor
Assistant: Falling from a significant height can cause serious injuries, including possible head trauma or internal bleeding. It’s important to look out for signs of confusion, dizziness, or loss of consciousness, as these could indicate a more severe condition.

Even if the injuries aren’t immediately obvious, it’s best to keep the person still and monitor them closely for symptoms. If they have any severe pain, trouble moving, or obvious wounds, getting prompt medical evaluation is recommended.
User: My friend is unconscious now, with a big wound on his head and a lot of bleeding. He’s breathing but not responding, so this indicates what and should I do CPR or call an ambulance or try to drive him to the hospital. Also, do I need to move him carefully in case of a neck injury? Please give a clear step-by-step method.
