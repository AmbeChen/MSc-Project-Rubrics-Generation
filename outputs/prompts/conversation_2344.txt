User: I keep feeling like there’s a clogged chunk of wax in my left ear. I’m not in pain, there’s no discharge, and I’ve never had an ear infection or a perforated eardrum. My hearing seems fine, but I’m sick of the stuffy feeling. Can I safely try to flush it out at home, or is there something else I can do to loosen it?
