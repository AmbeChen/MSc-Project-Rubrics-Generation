User: Insulin regimens for newly diagnosed pediatric T1D
Assistant: The initial insulin regimen for newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in pediatric patients generally involves a combination of basal and bolus insulin. Below is a common approach:

---

**1. Determining Total Daily Dose (TDD)**
  - For children, an initial TDD of around 0.5–0.8 units/kg/day is often used.
  - Adjustments are based on factors such as age, body weight, and stage of puberty.

**2. Basal-Bolus Ratio**
  - The basal insulin typically accounts for roughly 30–40% of the TDD.
  - The remaining 60–70% is split among bolus doses, administered before meals.

**3. Types of Insulin**
  - **Basal (long-acting)**: Examples include glargine or detemir.
  - **Bolus (rapid-acting)**: Examples include lispro, aspart, or glulisine.

**4. Monitoring and Adjustments**
  - Frequent blood glucose checks and dose titrations are crucial.
  - Monitor for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia patterns.

Would you like details on dose titration or adjustments over time?
User: Actually, I'm a pediatric endocrinologist referencing the 2021 ISPAD guidelines. The ratio you listed for newly diagnosed pediatric patients doesn't align with that guidance. According to the official ISPAD recommendations, basal insulin should typically account for around 40–60% of the TDD in newly diagnosed children. I'd like an updated approach reflecting those guidelines.
