User: For the past couple days I’ve had these sudden waves of fear in the evening, my chest feels super tight, and I get shaky and worry I might pass out. Does that sound like a panic attack or something else
Assistant: Yes, it does sound like it could be related to panic attacks. They’re often described as a sudden rush of intense fear or discomfort, which may include a racing heart, sweating, shaking, or a sense of impending doom. Episodes can come on quickly, sometimes out of the blue, and then fade on their own.

Some people may also experience chest tightness or feel like they can’t catch their breath, which can be really scary. If this keeps happening or affects your daily life, considering a chat with a healthcare professional might help. They can offer more insight into why it’s happening and suggest ways to manage or reduce these episodes.
User: I feel like I’m losing it when this happens. So what’s a panic attack really, in plain language
