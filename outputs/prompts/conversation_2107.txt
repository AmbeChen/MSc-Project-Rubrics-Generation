User: So I'd like to create a standard operative note for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Here’s what I need: pre-op diagnosis, post-op diagnosis, procedure details, references to CPT codes, anesthesia details, the works. I'd like a concise but professional format. Anything else you’d suggest to include?
Assistant: A typical operative note includes these core sections:

1. **Patient Identification**: (Name, age, etc.)
2. **Pre-Operative Diagnosis**: (Reason for surgery, for example symptomatic cholelithiasis)
3. **Post-Operative Diagnosis**: (Often the same if confirmed intraoperatively)
4. **Procedure**: (Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, plus any additional procedures)
5. **Surgeon & Assistants**: (Names or roles)
6. **Anesthesia**: (Type of anesthesia used)
7. **Operative Findings & Details**: (Description of the gallbladder, any adhesions)
8. **Specimen Removed**: (Gallbladder)
9. **Estimated Blood Loss**: (EBL in milliliters)
10. **Drain/Device Placement**: (If any)
11. **Complications**: (If none, state “No intraoperative complications”)
12. **Disposition**: (Patient condition post-op)
13. **CPT Code(s)**: (If needed for billing/documentation)
14. **Surgeon’s Signature & Date**

Let me know if you'd like me to draft a sample text based on your patient details.
User: Ok, my patient was a 40-year-old female with symptomatic cholelithiasis. Intraop findings: mild adhesions but otherwise unremarkable. Let’s confirm if 47562 is the correct CPT code. Also mention prophylactic antibiotics (we used cefazolin), total EBL of 50 mL, and that there were no complications. I'd like your help finalizing the text.
