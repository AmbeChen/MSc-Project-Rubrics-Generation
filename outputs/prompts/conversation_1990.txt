User: 55yo male, hiccups x3 days, what treatment options should i consider?
Assistant: For persistent hiccups lasting over 48 hours, first-line treatment is usually pharmacological. Chlorpromazine is commonly used; alternatives include metoclopramide or baclofen. It's also important to assess for underlying causes like GERD, CNS lesions, or metabolic imbalances.
User: any specific dosage recommendations for chlorpromazine?
