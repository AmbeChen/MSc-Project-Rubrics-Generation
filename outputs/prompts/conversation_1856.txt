User: tms for severe depression? any long term success data, like beyond 2 years?
Assistant: transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) has shown promise in treatment-resistant cases, but data on extended outcomes can be mixed. some reports indicate maintained benefits for many individuals, though relapse rates vary. factors such as patient history and concurrent therapy also matter.

### potential considerations
1. **study variations**: different trials measure success in different ways (response vs remission), so long-term comparisons can be tricky.
2. **maintenance sessions**: some patients undergo additional tms sessions later, which can influence sustained results.
3. **small sample sizes**: many long-term studies have relatively few participants, so findings may not generalize.

### caution
lack of large, standardized trials means uncertainty about exact rates. continued monitoring and tailored care are generally recommended.
User: i want to know if there’s a consensus on 3-year remission rates. i’d like to plan for my patients.
