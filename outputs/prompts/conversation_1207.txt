User: Hey there! I’ve been seeing teenage mothers in my practice who are dealing with postpartum depression. The research on psychosocial interventions for adolescents seems really limited, so I’m not sure what’s best. Any recommendations on well-supported programs or approaches specifically for teenage moms?
