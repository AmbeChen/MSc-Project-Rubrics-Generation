User: So I'm going to describe what's going on with my dad and you can say if it's something urgent or not. My dad just said he's feeling off after a stressful phone call with my aunt, but he won't say if he's dizzy or in pain, just that he's not right. I'm not sure if this could be something serious or if we can just wait until tomorrow to see how he is. I'm kind of worried, though.
