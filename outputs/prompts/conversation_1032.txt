Hello!

We suspect stable angina in a 52-year-old patient with typical chest pain. We're looking for a stepwise diagnostic approach, from assessing pre-test probability to determining whether non-invasive imaging or stress testing is appropriate. We'll share the findings with the cardiology team soon.

We also want an overview of how to interpret the pre-test probability. Are there recommended tools or scoring systems to decide who needs imaging?

Also, if you have any concise diagnostic algorithm from guidelines or major cardiology societies, I'd appreciate it. Thank you!
