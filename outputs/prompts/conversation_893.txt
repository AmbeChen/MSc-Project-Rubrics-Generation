User: my client is a 35-year old man who fell from a ladder 30 minutes ago – he’s been mildly confused ever since, though his pulse is 95 bpm, blood pressure 130/85, and he’s got a gcs of 14 – could you write me an educated response addressing how urgent it is for him to undergo hospital imaging and further trauma evaluation
