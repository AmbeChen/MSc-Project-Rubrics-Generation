User: Neighbor with fever and bleeding
Assistant: Fever with bleeding can have various causes, such as:

1. **Ebola virus disease**: Notable in certain areas of eastern Congo, including North Kivu.
2. **Other viral hemorrhagic fevers**: Marburg, Lassa, or Crimean-Congo.
3. **Severe bacterial infections**: In rarer cases, some bacterial infections can lead to bleeding.
4. **Malaria with complications**: Though usually less likely to cause severe bleeding, advanced cases can be serious.

### What you can do:
- **Isolate**: Keep the person away from others to avoid potential spread.
- **Protect yourself**: Use protective clothing if possible.
- **Contact health authorities**: Alert local health teams or an emergency line.
- **Monitor**: Check for other symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, rash, confusion).

If bleeding persists or the person has high fever and signs of shock, seek professional care immediately. Would you like advice specific to your region?
