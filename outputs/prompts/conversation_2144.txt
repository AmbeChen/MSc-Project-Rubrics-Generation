User: give me the top recommended first line medication for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes i want official guidelines
Assistant: Here are some major points from widely recognized clinical guidelines on first-line pharmacotherapy for adults with type 2 diabetes:

1. **Metformin (Generic)**  
   - Often considered the first-line agent in the absence of contraindications.  
   - Generally well tolerated, can help with weight control, and has a good safety profile.

2. **Lifestyle Modifications**  
   - Dietary changes (portion control, limiting refined sugars, etc.)
   - Physical activity (150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise)

3. **Initial Monitoring**  
   - Often recommend checking fasting glucose and sometimes postprandial glucose, along with periodic HbA1c measurements.

4. **Additional Considerations**  
   - In patients with high cardiovascular risk, some guidelines consider SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists earlier in therapy.
   - Monitor kidney function and other comorbidities.

Each patientâ€™s profile is unique, so it is important to tailor the choice of medication to individual clinical factors.
