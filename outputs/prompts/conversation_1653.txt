1. Choose an injection site: common areas include the abdomen, thighs, arms, and buttocks.
2. Clean the area with an alcohol swab.
3. Prepare the insulin syringe or pen as per instructions.
4. Pinch the skin and insert the needle at a 90-degree angle.
5. Inject the insulin and remove the needle.
6. Dispose of the needle safely.
User: I'm having trouble visualizing the injection sites. Are there any resources that can help?
Assistant: Yes, there are diagrams available that show common injection sites, such as the abdomen, thighs, arms, and buttocks. These visual aids can help you understand where to administer your injections.
User: Also, I'm visually impaired; I need auditory explanations or audio guides for administering insulin.
