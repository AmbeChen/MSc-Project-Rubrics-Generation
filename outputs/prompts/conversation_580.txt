User: I keep getting these pimples on my cheeks and forehead. I'm 14, no known allergies, no major skin issues, and I'd like a simple over-the-counter product to clear them. suggestions?
Assistant: Mild acne can often be managed with over-the-counter topicals. Here are some steps you could try:

### 1. Gentle Cleansing
- Use a mild, non-comedogenic facial cleanser morning and night.
- Avoid scrubbing too hard—irritation can worsen breakouts.

### 2. Targeted Active Ingredients
- **Salicylic Acid**: Helps clear clogged pores and reduce inflammation.
- **Benzoyl Peroxide (2.5% to 5%)**: Kills acne-causing bacteria and can reduce redness.
- **Retinol or Adapalene**: Encourages skin turnover, but might cause dryness at first.

### 3. Moisturize
- A light, oil-free moisturizer can help prevent dryness or peeling.

### 4. Patch Test
- Test new products on a small area first to ensure no adverse reactions.

If you have questions about how these might fit your routine, let me know!
User: I tried a generic facial wash but it's not strong enough. I want something that specifically targets breakouts. I'd prefer a gel or a cream. I've never used acne meds before, so maybe something not too harsh
Assistant: Sure. Since you’re new to acne treatments, it’s often best to start with a milder product:

### 1. **Benzoyl Peroxide Gel (2.5%)**
- Good at reducing acne-causing bacteria.
- Lower concentrations can be less drying but still effective.

### 2. **Salicylic Acid Cream or Gel (1-2%)**
- Gentle exfoliation, helps unclog pores.
- Can be used once or twice a day.

### 3. **Apply Gradually**
- Start once daily in the evening.
- If no irritation, you can move to twice daily.

Keep an eye on dryness or redness. If it gets worse, scale back to every other day.
User: Ok I'm leaning toward the benzoyl peroxide one. If I see dryness or peeling, do I just stop or keep going? I'd like to do it right.
