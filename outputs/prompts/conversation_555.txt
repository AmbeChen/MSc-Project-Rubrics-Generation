User: What is the best approach for an outpatient progress note for a suspicious skin lesion
Assistant: It looks like you're referencing a skin lesion, but before finalizing a note, can you clarify which details you have so we can structure it properly?
User: The lesion is new, about 6mm, with irregular borders, present for 2 weeks. There's no itching or bleeding. I'm worried about possible melanoma.
Assistant: So youâ€™re looking to create an outpatient progress note. Are there any additional exam findings or assessment details you want to include?
User: Yes. Here is everything: Subjective: Pt states new dark mole for 2 weeks, no itching or bleeding. Objective: 6mm lesion with irregular border on left shoulder. Assessment: possible dysplastic nevus. Plan: excisional biopsy next week. Format as a SOAP note.
