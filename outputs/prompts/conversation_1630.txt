User: When I'm dealing with migraines with aura for about eight years already, and I've tried topiramate and propranolol for prevention and also used triptans as rescue medication, and I've been tracking frequency and triggers in a detailed headache journal that shows stress and bright light as the main triggers, with normal MRI results, and no other health problems, I'm starting to wonder if a CGRP inhibitor might be more effective or if I should just keep taking topiramate and hope my headaches calm down eventually?
