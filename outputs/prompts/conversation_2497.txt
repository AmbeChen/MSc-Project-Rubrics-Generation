User: First trimester ultrasound in a santiago public clinic
Assistant: In Chile’s public healthcare system, the first-trimester ultrasound is usually performed to confirm pregnancy, estimate gestational age, and check the embryo’s overall health. Here are some key points:

### 1. **Timing**
- Generally scheduled between 7–12 weeks of pregnancy.
- Chilean guidelines often recommend having it around the eighth to tenth week.

### 2. **Referral Process**
- In public clinics (consultorios), you usually receive a referral from a midwife or doctor.
- Once you have the referral, you can book an appointment at the ultrasound unit or be directed to a central scheduling system.

### 3. **What to Expect**
- An internal (transvaginal) ultrasound may be done if the pregnancy is very early.
- The exam checks the embryo’s heartbeat, confirms the number of fetuses, and detects any early concerns.

### 4. **Costs**
- Public insurance (FONASA) typically covers the exam in public facilities.
- If there’s a waiting list, your clinic may arrange an alternate facility at no extra cost.

### 5. **Follow-Up**
- Your midwife or doctor will use the results to guide prenatal care.
- You’ll likely have additional scans later in pregnancy.

If you have special circumstances or concerns, it’s good to discuss them with your healthcare team so they can schedule the ultrasound accordingly.
