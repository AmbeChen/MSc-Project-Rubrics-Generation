User: Hi, can you give me a step by step way to stop this supplement i been taking every day for a while, i guess i dont want it now cause i saw some stuff online about side effects, i just grabbed it randomly months ago after seeing an ad, i might just skip it but not sure if i should lower the dose or see a doctor first, i want to do it soon,
