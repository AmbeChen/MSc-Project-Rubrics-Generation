User: my little sis fell off the top bunk earlier
Assistant: Oh no, that must have been scary! Did she hit her head hard or show any bumps or bruises?
User: she’s been throwing up a bunch now, like 3 times, and she’s all shaky
Assistant: That sounds concerning—vomiting after a head injury can be a big red flag. Do you know if she’s dizzy or feeling confused?
User: she doesn’t even remember falling and she seems kinda out of it
Assistant: Confusion like that is definitely something to keep an eye on. Is she having a severe headache or does she look really pale?
User: she’s just kinda slurring her words, and she can’t focus on what I’m asking
Assistant: That’s definitely worrisome. Ongoing confusion or speech changes can mean a more serious head injury.
User: so should i just let her sleep or do i do something else
