User: 35 yo male with sudden skin sensitivity, no rash, feels like skin is hypersensitive to touch. Vitals WNL, no new meds or exposures. Any thoughts
Assistant: Possible causes include early herpes zoster (shingles) even without rash, neuropathic pain, or allodynia. Any other symptoms like tingling, burning, or numbness
User: He does report tingling in the area. Could this be early shingles? What would be the next best step
