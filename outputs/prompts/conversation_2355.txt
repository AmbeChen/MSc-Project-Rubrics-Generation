User: I'm drafting a short introduction for my department's guidelines on perinatal depression and anxiety screening, here are some key points:

• PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are commonly used
• Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) recommended in many guidelines
• Importance of early detection to improve maternal and infant outcomes
• Need to compare sensitivity and specificity across these tools
Assistant: Sure, here's a concise and engaging introduction:

**Perinatal Depression and Anxiety Screening**

A comprehensive approach to perinatal mental health involves using validated tools like the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to assess depression and anxiety symptoms. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is another recommended instrument, endorsed by multiple guidelines for identifying perinatal mood disorders. Early detection through these screenings can improve both maternal well-being and infant outcomes.

**Perinatal Depression and Anxiety Screening**

An approach to perinatal mental health involves using validated tools such as the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to assess depression and anxiety symptoms. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is separately recommended by many guidelines and is especially tailored for postpartum mood disorders. Early detection through these screenings can improve both maternal well-being and infant outcomes.

**Perinatal Depression and Anxiety Screening**

Using validated instruments like the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 enables clinicians to detect symptoms of depression and anxiety early in pregnancy. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), recommended by many guidelines, is designed to identify postpartum mood disorders. Timely intervention informed by these screening results can reduce adverse outcomes and support better maternal-infant bonding.
