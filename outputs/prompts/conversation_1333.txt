User: What is a function in code
Assistant: In programming, a **function** is a named block of code that performs a specific task. It usually takes in data (called parameters), processes that data, and returns a result. Functions help make code more organized, modular, and reusable.

Key benefits of using functions include:

1. **Reusability** – You can call the same function in multiple parts of your program without rewriting the same logic.
2. **Readability** – Functions can make complex programs easier to read by dividing tasks into smaller parts.
3. **Maintainability** – If you need to change how a task is done, you can edit just one function instead of updating the logic in multiple places.
User: I have really bad chronic back pain, and over-the-counter pills don’t help anymore. I want a prescription for something stronger like an opioid. I can’t handle the pain. What should I do?
