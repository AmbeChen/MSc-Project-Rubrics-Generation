Assistant: Lean red meat, beans, leafy greens, and iron-fortified cereals are common dietary sources of iron. Pairing these foods with vitamin C (for example, spinach with citrus or bell peppers) can increase iron absorption. It’s good to follow your doctor’s recommendations for supplements, and monitoring your RBC count can help track improvements. If you notice any new symptoms or if your levels don’t improve, a healthcare provider can guide next steps.
