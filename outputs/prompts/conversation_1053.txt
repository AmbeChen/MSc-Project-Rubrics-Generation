User: What might be reasons I get dizzy once a month I’m not on any meds my blood pressure’s around 110/70
Assistant: Occasional dizziness can be related to things like dehydration, low blood sugar, or inner ear issues. If it’s mild and only happens once a month, it might not be serious. But it’s good to monitor any changes or additional symptoms.
