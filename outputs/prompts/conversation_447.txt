User: The following data had been gleaned from a caretakerâ€™s shift for <PATIENT_NAME>. The patient is 65 years old, had a mild stroke about two weeks ago, appears stable. No previous stroke history is confirmed, and no record of any medication usage is provided. Vital signs were not documented, and no lab tests or other clinical measures were reported. The caretaker ended the shift without further details.

Hence compute the ABC stroke risk for <PATIENT_NAME> and put it in a final numeric form.
