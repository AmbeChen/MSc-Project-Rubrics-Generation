User: PNEUMONIA GUIDELINES
Assistant: Pneumonia is an acute infection of the lung parenchyma. It can range from mild to severe and is typically categorized by setting (community-acquired, hospital-acquired, or ventilator-associated). Below is a brief overview:

### **1. Common Etiologies**
- **Bacterial:** Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, atypical organisms (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae), Legionella species.
- **Viral:** Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), SARS-CoV-2.

### **2. Clinical Assessment**
- **Symptoms:** Cough (often productive), fever, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain.
- **Physical Exam Findings:** Crackles on auscultation, dullness on percussion if consolidation is present.
- **Diagnostic Tools:** Chest X-ray, sputum culture, blood cultures, procalcitonin or CRP, pulse oximetry.

### **3. Risk Stratification**
- **CURB-65 Score:** Confusion, Urea >7 mmol/L, Respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, Blood pressure (systolic <90 mmHg or diastolic ≤60 mmHg), age ≥ 65. Used to determine inpatient vs outpatient management.

Guidelines emphasize early recognition, stratification of severity, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

### **1. Empiric Antibiotic Therapy**
- **Outpatient (low risk):** A macrolide (e.g., azithromycin) or doxycycline if atypical coverage is needed and local resistance patterns allow.
- **Outpatient (comorbidities):** A respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., levofloxacin) or a beta-lactam (like amoxicillin-clavulanate) plus a macrolide.
- **Inpatient (moderate to severe):** Beta-lactam (e.g., ceftriaxone) plus a macrolide, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone in certain cases.

### **2. Supportive Care**
- Oxygen supplementation if hypoxic.
- IV fluids, analgesics, antipyretics as needed.

### **3. Monitoring and Complications**
- Track vitals and clinical response.
- Watch for complications like effusions, empyema, or respiratory failure.

Early initiation of the correct antibiotic regimen is crucial to improve outcomes. Adjust therapy based on culture results and clinical response.
