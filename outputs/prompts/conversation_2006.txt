User: i'm wearing these brand new shoes and they're giving me painful blisters on my feet. i read some things about using thick socks or breaking them in slowly. i want to make sure i don't get more blisters and also what to do if they start forming. is it a bad idea to put bandages on before i go out or should i just let my feet get used to the shoes? i don't want to end up with worse blisters or infections.
