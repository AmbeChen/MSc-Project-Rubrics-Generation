User: Here is what I found :

BCG Vaccine :- recommended at birth
OPV Vaccine :- recommended at birth and 6 weeks
DTP Vaccine :- recommended at 6, 10, and 14 weeks

What do you understand from this schedule
Assistant: From this schedule, it looks like a list of early-life vaccinations typically given to infants to protect against tuberculosis (BCG), polio (OPV), and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP). It suggests that some of these vaccines should be administered at birth, and others at specific intervals during the first few months of life, which is standard practice in many immunization programs.

BCG is often given soon after birth to protect against tuberculosis, while OPV targets polio and may involve multiple doses. DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) is usually given in a series to ensure ongoing immunity. Overall, these are common components of a newborn immunization schedule designed to prevent serious infectious diseases early in life.
