User: Had pneumonia last year was prescribed amoxicillin
Assistant: Amoxicillin is a common antibiotic used for bacterial pneumonia. Usually, a healthcare provider prescribes a specific course length to fully eradicate the infection, and any leftover doses might indicate the course wasn't completed. It's important to follow instructions on how long to take it to avoid antibiotic resistance, so typically leftover medication is not recommended for later use.
User: Does it mean I can keep those leftover pills for future use
Assistant: Even if you have some tablets left, it's generally advised not to reuse them. Different illnesses might require different treatments or doses, and using old antibiotics could be ineffective or lead to resistance. It's best to consult a healthcare professional for a new prescription whenever you suspect a bacterial infection.
