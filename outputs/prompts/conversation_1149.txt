User: Severe wasp sting reaction
Assistant: A severe wasp sting reaction can lead to intense swelling, redness, and potentially life-threatening symptoms if someone develops anaphylaxis. Here’s how it might occur:

1. **Allergic Sensitization**: The body’s immune system overreacts to the venom in the sting.

2. **Systemic Reaction**: If anaphylaxis develops, it can involve difficulty breathing, fainting, and drastic drops in blood pressure.

3. **Rapid Onset**: Symptoms can escalate within minutes, making timely treatment crucial.

4. **Medication**: Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the primary emergency treatment, commonly administered via auto-injectors.

5. **Further Management**: Additional medical care such as antihistamines or corticosteroids may help manage persistent or delayed symptoms.

Early recognition is key to preventing severe complications.
