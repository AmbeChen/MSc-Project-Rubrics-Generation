User: hey can you help me figure out the codes for a newborn exam with mild jaundice i also want cpt codes for the routine exam plus if phototherapy is needed
Assistant: Sure, I can help with that. Please share any details about the baby’s birth history, labs, and exam findings so I can suggest the correct codes.
User: use short paragraphs please
Assistant: Certainly! Could you provide the baby’s age, feeding pattern, and any lab values or specific exam details? That information will help me determine the most accurate codes.
