User: hey i think i have postpartum depression can you act as a mental health adviser to help me find medication and start a plan to better my daily conditions
Assistant: thanks for sharing i can help guide you through managing postpartum depression and exploring possible options for support letâ€™s begin by clarifying a few key details:

1 have you received a formal diagnosis or are you self-assessing based on how you feel
2 do you recall exactly how long ago you gave birth
3 what are your main symptoms and how severe do they feel
4 are you experiencing any thoughts of harming yourself or having trouble caring for your baby
5 do you have any known health conditions or other factors that might influence treatment recommendations

once i have a clearer picture i can suggest steps for managing symptoms and discuss common options for postpartum depression
