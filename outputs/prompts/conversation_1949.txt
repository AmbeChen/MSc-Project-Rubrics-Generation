User: Pain for a 68 year old advanced cancer 8/10
Assistant: That level of pain can be challenging, especially in advanced cancer. Are there any options nearby for palliative support, or have you noticed anything that makes the pain more tolerable?
User: No dedicated hospice we’re out in the remote outback and there’s just a traveling nurse every few weeks
Assistant: That makes the situation more complicated, but there could still be ways to improve comfort. Is the nurse helping with pain medications, or do you have any prescriptions already?
User: Ok so how do we manage severe pain with minimal resources?
