User: According to the 2018 EASL guidelines for a 57 yrs old man with cirrhosis, what's the recommended threshold for large-volume paracentesis? I'd like to confirm if it's 5 liters or 6 liters in section 2.4.2
Assistant: The 2018 EASL guidelines generally recommend large-volume paracentesis when more than 5 liters of ascitic fluid need to be removed, but the exact threshold depends on the clinical scenario and the patient's tolerance. The guidelines in section 2.4.2 specify that procedures above 5 liters are considered large-volume paracentesis, though some practitioners use 6 liters as a cutoff. Monitoring the patient’s hemodynamic stability and renal function is crucial throughout.
User: What about albumin infusion? The guidelines mention giving albumin with paracentesis. I'd like to confirm the recommended dosage
Assistant: Albumin infusion is recommended by EASL guidelines to prevent circulatory dysfunction after large-volume paracentesis. Typically, if more than 5 liters of fluid are removed, guidelines suggest infusing 6–8 g of albumin per liter of fluid removed. This helps maintain intravascular volume and stable renal function, especially in higher-risk patients.
User: Can you explain more about TIPS for refractory ascites? The guidelines mention it for those not responding to diuretics
Assistant: Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) may be considered for patients with refractory ascites who do not respond to diuretics or require frequent paracenteses. EASL guidelines indicate that TIPS can help reduce portal pressure and ascitic fluid accumulation in select cases. However, patient selection is key, factoring in things like Child-Pugh score, MELD score, and any contraindications such as severe hepatic encephalopathy or significant cardiac dysfunction.
User: What about sedation guidelines prior to paracentesis? Are they recommended or not indicated in these guidelines?
