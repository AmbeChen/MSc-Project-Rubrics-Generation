User: hey, my mom's leg is kind of swollen and has a small bump. should i be worried?
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear about your mom's leg. Can you tell me more about the swelling and the bump? How long has it been there, and does she have any pain or other symptoms?
User: it's been like two days. she says it's a bit sore but not too bad. i'm not sure if it's just swelling or a lump. what's the difference?
