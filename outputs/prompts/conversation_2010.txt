User: Is it OK to do the keto diet while pregnant? I’m trying to avoid too much weight gain.
Assistant: Yes, some women do follow low-carb diets during pregnancy, but it’s really important to balance your nutrition. You want to ensure you’re getting enough vitamins, minerals, and calories for both you and your baby. It's best to check with a healthcare provider, because everyone’s situation is different and nutrient demands go up in pregnancy.
User: What about side effects or risks to the baby?
