User: do yk how incisional hernias form
Assistant: Incisional hernias typically develop at or near a surgical incision site, often because the deep layers of the abdominal wall don’t heal properly. Factors that can contribute include:

1. **Poor wound healing**: Conditions such as infections, obesity, or diabetes can impair healing.
2. **Excessive strain**: Heavy lifting or intense coughing before the incision fully heals can weaken the repair.
3. **Technique or suture material**: Sometimes a less-than-ideal closure method can predispose the site to herniation.

User: for repair how do laparoscopic and open differ
Assistant: They differ primarily in how the surgeon accesses the hernia site:

- **Open repair**: Involves a larger incision over the hernia, allowing direct visualization and repair with sutures or mesh.

- **Laparoscopic repair**: Uses small incisions and a camera, often placing mesh from within the abdomen. It usually reduces postoperative pain and shortens recovery time but can require more advanced skills and equipment.

Are you looking for specific outcomes or complications related to each approach?
User: im interested in complication rates and length of stay from meta analyses
Assistant: Meta-analyses generally suggest laparoscopic repair can lead to:

1. **Lower wound infection rates**: Smaller incisions reduce the infection risk compared to open repair.
2. **Shorter hospital stay**: Many studies show a quicker return to normal activities and fewer days in the hospital.
3. **Potential for comparable recurrence rates**: Long-term hernia recurrence varies across studies, but most place laparoscopic and open techniques within a similar range.

However, the specifics can differ among patient populations and depends on surgeons’ expertise. Do you want references for these findings?
User: any references from the last 3 years focusing specifically on long term recurrence
