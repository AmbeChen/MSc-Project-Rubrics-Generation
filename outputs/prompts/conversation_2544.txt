User: which vaccines to get for traveling next month
Assistant: Travel vaccine recommendations can depend on the specific region you’ll be visiting. Some commonly recommended vaccines for travelers include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid vaccines, but it really varies based on where you’re going and what you’ll be doing.

Are you traveling to a particular country or region next month?
