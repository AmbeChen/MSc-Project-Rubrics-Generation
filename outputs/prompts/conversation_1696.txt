User: My patient is complaining of chest tightness and shortness of breath. Denies fever. Has a mild cough, but nothing else. Please write me a short note on those points.
Assistant: **Nursing Note:**

Patient is alert and oriented, reporting chest tightness and shortness of breath without fever. Mild cough noted. No additional complaints mentioned. Will monitor respiratory status and comfort level, and reassess as needed.
User: Now letâ€™s do a Wells score for suspected pulmonary embolism based on the above information. Tell me if this is likely or moderate risk.
