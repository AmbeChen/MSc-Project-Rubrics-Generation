User: My patient is a 65-year-old with multiple myeloma. We’re thinking about limiting the radiation fields to reduce side effects, but I’ve seen inconclusive data on how this approach affects long-term disease control. Are there any robust studies confirming partial radiation therapy as effective for multiple myeloma? Feel free to ask clarifying questions
