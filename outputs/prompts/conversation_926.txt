User: I’m 4 weeks postpartum and sometimes feel sad or start crying for no reason, but overall I’m managing my baby just fine. Is it safe to wait until my check-up next week, or should I get help sooner?
Assistant: Mild mood changes are fairly common after delivery, but it’s a good idea to keep track of how often these feelings occur and if they’re getting worse. If you have any thoughts of harming yourself or the baby, or if your sadness becomes more intense, you should reach out to a healthcare provider right away. Otherwise, it’s usually fine to wait until your scheduled appointment next week to discuss how you’re feeling, mention your mood changes, and see if additional support could be helpful.

Consider sharing how you’re coping with a friend or family member you trust, and try to rest when possible. It might help to connect with other new parents or a support group to talk about common postpartum experiences. You can also let your doctor know in advance that you’re having some emotional ups and downs, so they can keep an eye on how you’re doing at your check-up next week.
User: I’m also really tired, but I still manage to handle everything at home. Is it ok to wait until then to talk about my fatigue too?
