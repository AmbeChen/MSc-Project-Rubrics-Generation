User: Stem cell injections for mild degenerative disc disease—any recognized guidelines or robust data for disc rehydration? I'm a spine surgeon seeking clarity.
Assistant: Existing evidence on stem cell injections for mild degenerative disc disease is still in early stages. Preliminary trials suggest potential benefits in disc hydration and pain relief, but the sample sizes are small and the follow-up periods are short. Here’s an overview:

**1. Preliminary Studies**
- A few pilot studies have explored intradiscal injection of mesenchymal stem cells.
- Some report modest improvements in pain and MRI findings, though results vary.

**2. Mechanism**
- Stem cells may differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells or secrete growth factors to stimulate disc regeneration.
- The exact mechanisms are still being investigated.

**3. Guidelines**
- No widely accepted guidelines endorse it as a primary therapy.
- Most professional bodies consider it experimental, pending larger trials.

**4. Limitations**
- Variability in stem cell source, dose, and injection protocol.
- Lack of long-term data on safety and effectiveness.

Because of these uncertainties, many spine specialists view stem cell therapy as a promising but unproven adjunct for mild degenerative changes, rather than a standard of care.
