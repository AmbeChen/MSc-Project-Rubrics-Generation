User: phq9 usage intervals
Assistant: The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) is commonly used to gauge symptom severity and track response to treatment for depression.

### Typical Usage Intervals
- **Initial Screening**: Administered at baseline to establish the presence and severity of depressive symptoms.
- **Follow-Up Assessments**: Often weekly or bi-weekly in active treatment phases to measure improvement.
- **Maintenance**: Less frequent intervals, sometimes monthly or quarterly, for ongoing monitoring.

### Considerations
- **Symptom Changes**: A high or escalating score may warrant more frequent re-checks.
- **Treatment Adjustments**: Used to guide medication changes, therapy modifications, or referral decisions.
- **Clinical Context**: Interval selection can depend on patient engagement, risk level, and access to care.

### Limitations
- **Snapshot**: The PHQ-9 offers a brief snapshot of depressive symptom severity.
- **Clinical Judgment**: Scores should be interpreted alongside clinical impressions. A thorough assessment may include additional tools or interviews.
