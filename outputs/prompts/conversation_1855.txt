User: write me a 2 sentence note about continuing glyburide vs switching to insulin in a patient with advanced cirrhosis. mention that glyburide’s hepatic metabolism is unpredictable and official guidelines often suggest insulin if there’s a high risk of hypoglycemia
Assistant: Dear Dr. Patterson,

Because of this patient’s advanced cirrhosis, glyburide’s unpredictable hepatic metabolism could raise the risk of severe hypoglycemia, and guidelines often recommend insulin when there’s a concern about safe glucose control. I think it’s important we carefully weigh the benefits of continuing glyburide against switching to insulin, especially if hypoglycemia risk is high.

Assistant: Hey Dr. Patterson,

Glyburide can be tricky in advanced cirrhosis because the liver might not handle it well, so guidelines often lean toward insulin if there’s a good chance of big blood sugar drops. It’s worth checking how stable the patient’s glucose is and possibly switching to insulin if there’s any serious concern.
