User: is this ear candlin brand from earkare inc safe for ear trouble? ear candlin kit 200
Assistant: Yes, **ear candlin kit 200** is a type of product people use in an alternative practice known as ear candling. It involves inserting a hollow candle into the ear canal and lighting it, supposedly to draw out wax or impurities. While some individuals claim it helps with ear issues, scientific evidence is lacking, and most medical professionals caution against it due to potential safety risks, such as burns or ear canal blockages.
