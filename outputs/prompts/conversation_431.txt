User: If I need help, what's the difference between fish oil capsules vs flaxseed for daily omega-3? I'm 35, no known allergies or conditions, I'm not on anything else. It's just a sign to me that I'm overthinking, but I'd like to reduce animal-based products if possible. I've heard fish oil might be better for overall health, but I'm not sure. It's been weeks, I'm just stuck. It's not urgent, but I'd like an answer. I don't know.
