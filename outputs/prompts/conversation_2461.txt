User: I’m a 47-year-old ophthalmologist, and I run a small practice where we mainly handle routine eye exams and cataract management. I’m looking to expand into laser vision correction. I want to confirm the official guidelines on patient candidacy, including recommended corneal thickness thresholds, dryness screening protocols, and topographic evaluation. I’d also like to know the standard intervals for post-op follow-up. I’ve been reviewing some 2022 guidelines from the Ophthalmic Surgeons Association, but I want to be sure I’m completely up to date. Two of my staff members have completed a short course on microkeratome usage for flap creation. I’d appreciate your perspective on how best to implement these expansions in line with recommended practices.
