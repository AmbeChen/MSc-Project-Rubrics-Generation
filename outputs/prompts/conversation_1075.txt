User: Give me a 3-day plan to handle a mild sunburn on my arms and face. I'd like to keep it under $20 total from Walgreens or Rite Aid.
Assistant: Here’s a **3-day sunburn care plan** that stays under **$20** and focuses on soothing and healing:

---

### **Day 1**
- **Cool Compress**: Apply a towel soaked in cool water to your arms and face for 10 minutes.
- **Aloe Vera Gel**: Choose a basic store-brand aloe vera gel (~$5) and apply a thin layer.
- **Oral Pain Relief (Optional)**: Over-the-counter ibuprofen (~$4) if needed for discomfort.
- **Hydrate**: Drink extra water or low-sugar electrolyte drinks.

### **Day 2**
- **Gentle Cleansing**: Use mild soap (store brand, ~$2) and lukewarm water.
- **Moisturizer**: Apply an unscented lotion with soothing ingredients (~$3).
- **Aloe Vera Reapply**: Reapply the aloe vera gel 2-3 times.

### **Day 3**
- **Cool Shower**: Keep showers short with cooler water.
- **Calming Lotion**: Pick a lotion containing oatmeal or chamomile (~$4).
- **Continue Hydration**: Aim for at least 8 cups of water.
