User: Hey so I'm going to the beach soon and I'm getting really worried about sun damage, like I see these little spots on my arms already. Is sunscreen basically just for preventing sunburn, or does it protect deeper stuff too? I have no clue how it actually stops UV rays.
Assistant: It can definitely feel concerning to notice new spots on your skin! Sunscreen serves a bigger purpose than just preventing sunburn. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Physical vs. Chemical Filters**: Some sunscreens use ingredients (like zinc oxide) that physically deflect rays (like tiny mirrors), while others use chemicals (like avobenzone) that absorb UV rays and turn them into harmless heat. Both keep these rays from going too far into your skin.

2. **UV Rays**: There are two main types: UVA (which can contribute to aging and deeper damage) and UVB (which is often responsible for sunburn). A broad-spectrum sunscreen will help guard against both.

3. **Protecting More Than Just Surface**: While sunburn is on the surface, deeper layers of your skin can still get damaged if UV rays slip through. This damage can build up over time and show up as wrinkles, dark spots, or worse. Sunscreen helps prevent that by blocking or absorbing those rays.

4. **Preventing Cell Damage**: Repeated exposure without protection can weaken skin cells and collagen, accelerating aging or potentially leading to more serious issues. Wearing sunscreen regularly gives your skin that buffer.

If you've got these new spots, it’s great you're thinking about sun protection now. And remember: sun protection isn’t just for the beach; it can help anytime you’re out in the sun. Let me know if you want more details about choosing the right sunscreen or anything else that’s on your mind.
User: This helps a lot. If I slather on a ton of sunscreen in the morning, does that cover me all day or do I need to keep reapplying? I'm still a bit confused about how SPF numbers work—like, is SPF 30 enough, or do I need to go higher?
