User: Radiology section says: 'Chest X-ray normal, no sign of infiltration' but in the plan it says: 'Left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.' how bad is that contradictory?
Assistant: It seems there is a mismatch between the findings in the radiology section and the plan. Usually, if the X-ray is normal, it shouldn't mention infiltration in the plan. However, sometimes a preliminary reading differs from the final reading, or there's a suspicion of pneumonia despite a negative X-ray. Clarifying the discrepancy would be essential, possibly by reviewing the final radiologist's report or getting additional imaging.
User: Here is the actual documentation:

**Radiology**: 'Chest X-ray: unremarkable with no signs of consolidation'

**Plan**: 'Left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia, start levofloxacin'

help me find the error in the note
