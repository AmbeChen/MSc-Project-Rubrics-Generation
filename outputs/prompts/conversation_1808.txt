User: Insulin pump brand X: advanced algorithm adjusting basal every 5 minutes
Trial data: improved time in range by about 15% for adults with T1

Assistant: Sure, here is a summary in English:

The advanced algorithm in brand X’s insulin pump monitors glucose trends and makes basal rate adjustments every five minutes. Clinical trial data showed about a 15% improvement in time in range among adults with type 1 diabetes. These pumps aim to keep users closer to a target glucose range by fine-tuning insulin delivery more frequently than older systems.

Assistant: Here is the summary again:

Brand X’s pump relies on frequent sensor readings, making basal insulin adjustments every five minutes to maintain glucose in a more stable range. According to one trial, this approach yielded a roughly 15% rise in the time blood sugar stayed within the target zone for adults with type 1 diabetes. The algorithm’s frequent fine-tuning can help reduce fluctuations compared with older pump models.
User: I want references from major RCTs too, not just a summary
