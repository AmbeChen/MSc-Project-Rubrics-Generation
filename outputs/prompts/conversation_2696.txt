User: my lower back is sore from gaming for hours and i hardly take breaks
Assistant: It sounds like you might be dealing with some muscle strain from sitting for long periods while gaming. Prolonged sitting can put a lot of stress on your back, especially if your chair or posture isn’t providing enough support. Do you have an ergonomic setup, or is your gaming station more of a standard desk and chair? Also, have you noticed these aches only recently, or have they been building up over time?
User: it is quite new i never had this problem before playing so much
Assistant: I’m sorry to hear that. If the pain started after you increased your gaming hours, it could very well be from repetitive strain and poor posture. Taking regular breaks is one of the most widely recommended steps to ease stress on your back and shoulders. Even standing up and stretching for a minute or two every hour can help. Have you tried any specific stretches or posture checks so far?
User: i do forget to stretch, also i use a normal chair and i slump. i want to fix this
Assistant: It’s easy to get so absorbed in gaming that we lose track of our posture. Many universally recognized posture guidelines suggest using a chair that supports the natural curve of your spine and keeping your feet flat on the floor. You could try putting a small cushion or rolled towel behind your lower back to help maintain a healthier posture. You might also set alarms to remind yourself to stretch or shift positions regularly.

Are there any particular times when the discomfort is worse, like after especially long sessions?
User: i also do a lot of VR gaming standing up, does that require different posture tips than the usual ones?
