User: Are there official guidelines for troponin measurement intervals in the ED from recognized emergency medicine associations?
Assistant: Yes, most guidelines recommend measuring cardiac troponin at presentation and then at a specified interval—often 3 hours, and possibly again around 6 hours—to rule in or rule out acute coronary syndrome. These recommendations come from various emergency medicine societies and cardiology bodies that focus on rapid evaluation of chest pain.
User: Which risk scores do they mention? I'm an emergency medicine physician, and I want the official guidelines from these recognized bodies.
