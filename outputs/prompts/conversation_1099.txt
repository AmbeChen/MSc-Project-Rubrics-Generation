User: So I've been working at a desk job for, I guess, a year and a half now. I'm starting to feel stiff and kind of sluggish from sitting so much. I keep thinking about doing some small exercises, maybe, or taking little walking breaks, but I'm not sure what's actually helpful. I'm not super active or anything, so I'm worried I'd do something wrong or I'd just give up. What do you think?
