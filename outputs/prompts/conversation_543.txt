User: hey i’m preparing a postpartum hemorrhage training for my new residents and referencing the updated ACOG guidelines. we mostly use pitocin and misoprostol, but i want to clarify how we should sequence uterotonics, including carboprost, plus recommended transfusion thresholds for acute blood loss. also how to integrate balloon tamponade and at what point we escalate to surgical intervention. i’d like tips on counseling staff to catch early warning signs in high-risk patients too
