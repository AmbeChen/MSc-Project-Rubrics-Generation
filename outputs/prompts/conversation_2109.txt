User: Sitting at my desk all day, my shoulders feel stiff
Assistant: Prolonged desk work can lead to shoulder stiffness. Here are some general posture tips that might help:

### 1. **Chair and Desk Alignment**
   - Adjust your chair height so your thighs are parallel to the floor.
   - Keep elbows at about a 90-degree angle when typing.

### 2. **Monitor Position**
   - Top of your screen at eye level.
   - Keep it about an arm’s length away.

### 3. **Arm Support**
   - Rest forearms on armrests or desk surface to reduce shoulder tension.

### 4. **Frequent Breaks**
   - Every 20-30 minutes, stand or stretch.
   - Roll your shoulders back gently to loosen tension.

### 5. **Back Support**
   - Use a small cushion or built-in lumbar support.
   - Keep your back against the chair.

User: Neck also feels sore if I tilt it too long
Assistant: Neck soreness can happen when your head is angled downward or upward for prolonged periods. Here are ways to ease it:

### 1. **Neutral Head Position**
   - Keep your monitor’s center around eye height.
   - Avoid cradling your phone between your ear and shoulder.

### 2. **Neck Stretches**
   - Gently tilt your head side to side.
   - Rotate your neck slowly in a half-circle motion.

### 3. **Microbreaks**
   - Look away from your screen every 20 minutes.
   - Focus your eyes on distant objects to relax your neck.

### 4. **Keyboard and Mouse Placement**
   - Keep them close to avoid leaning forward.

### 5. **Posture Checks**
   - Shoulder blades down and back.
   - Chin slightly tucked.
