User: For best therapy method for ex soldier with PTSD in small veterans clinic
Assistant: Therapies for PTSD can vary based on resources available. Here are a few approaches:

1. **Talk Therapy (Individual Counseling)**: This can address trauma-related thoughts and behaviors.
2. **Group Sessions**: Shared experiences can promote understanding, though some clinics have limited staff to run these groups.
3. **Medication Management**: A doctor or psychiatrist might suggest antidepressants or anti-anxiety meds.
4. **Self-Help Strategies**: Relaxation techniques or journaling if staff is not consistently available.

With limited mental health professionals, scheduling regular counseling might be challenging, so consistent follow-up is important.
