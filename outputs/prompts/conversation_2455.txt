User: My child won't eat vegetables at all, it's been a few months. I'm worried about them not getting enough nutrients from other sources. I haven't seen a pediatrician yet. I'm thinking about giving a multivitamin but I'm not sure if that's the right thing or which brand is good. My spouse says maybe we should try specialized vitamins for kids. Are there any that are considered safe? Should we do something else?
