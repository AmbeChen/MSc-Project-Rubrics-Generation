User: I'm a nurse. I want to provide some quick patient education on WHO guidelines for mild dehydration from diarrhea. The patient is a healthy adult who only had diarrhea for a day. I'd like to confirm how much fluid or oral rehydration solution to give, what the composition usually is, and how to administer it.
