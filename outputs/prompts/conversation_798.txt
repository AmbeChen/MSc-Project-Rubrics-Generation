User: mild ear discomfort from ear wax buildup, tell me about it
Assistant: Ear wax (**cerumen**) is a protective substance in the ear canal that helps trap dust and other particles. However, when it builds up excessively, it can cause mild discomfort or a feeling of fullness in the ear.

### Key Points
1. **Purpose**: Ear wax helps keep the ear canal clean and lubricated.
2. **Causes of Buildup**: Narrow ear canals, using cotton swabs, or producing too much wax can lead to blockages.
3. **Symptoms**: Mild pain, a sensation of fullness, or reduced hearing if the wax is impacted.
4. **Complications**: Usually minimal if there are no other symptoms like severe pain or discharge.

### When to Seek Help
- If you have severe pain, fever, or any discharge.
- If you notice significant hearing loss or dizziness.
