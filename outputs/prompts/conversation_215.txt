User: fix the grammar and make it better: january 2 2023 lumps was removed the patient was stable but the documentation doesn't mention the lumps location or technique used doc is uncertain
Assistant: Here's an improved version:

"On January 2, 2023, the patient's lumps were removed. The patient was stable, but the documentation does not specify the location of the lumps or the technique used, leaving the details unclear."
User: Now I'd also like the CPT code: lumps was removed january 2 2023
