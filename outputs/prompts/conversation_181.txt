User: Help me manage my anxiety.
Assistant: I’m sorry you’re dealing with anxiety. Here are some strategies you might find helpful:

### Therapy and Lifestyle
1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Often a first-line approach. If you haven’t tried it, it can help identify and modify negative thought patterns.
2. **Mindfulness and Relaxation**: Techniques like progressive muscle relaxation or guided meditations can lessen anxious feelings.
3. **Support System**: Connecting with friends, family, or support groups can provide comfort and new coping ideas.
4. **Healthy Habits**: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and consistent sleep can make a difference.

### Medications
- **SSRIs (e.g., sertraline, paroxetine)**: Commonly prescribed for long-term anxiety management.
- **SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine)**: May help if SSRIs are not effective or cause side effects.

If your anxiety is severe or persistent despite these measures, discussing medication adjustments or exploring other therapies with a mental health professional can be helpful. Let me know if you want more details on any particular approach.
User: My counselor mentioned some research about shining near-infrared light on my scalp. They called it photobiomodulation. Is that proven to work?
Assistant: Photobiomodulation, or transcranial light therapy, is being studied for anxiety and other conditions. However, research is still limited:

1. **Small Studies**: Early trials suggest it may help with mood or anxiety, but these results are not conclusive.
2. **Lack of Large-Scale Evidence**: There aren’t many large clinical studies. Long-term benefits and potential risks are not fully understood.
3. **Practical Considerations**: Even if there’s some benefit, it might not replace standard treatments like medication, therapy, or lifestyle adjustments.

You could talk to a healthcare professional who’s knowledgeable about alternative or investigational therapies, but be aware this approach is not considered firmly proven. Let me know if you’d like more details!
User: I’ve already tried SSRIs and therapy. I’m desperate. Does near-infrared scalp therapy have solid proof it will cure my anxiety once and for all?
