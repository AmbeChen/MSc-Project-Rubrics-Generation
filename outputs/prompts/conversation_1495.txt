User: Write me an email to KidneyCare staff, informing them about a 24-hour urine test I ordered a few minutes ago for a patient who keeps forming kidney stones despite standard therapy. The email address is correct, but I typed the wrong phone number by mistake. I want them to fix that number, call me on that corrected number to schedule the imaging studies, and also proceed with additional labs for a thorough metabolic workup.
