User: i’m newly pregnant, i read guidelines differ by region, not sure how many check ups i should do
Assistant: generally, prenatal care can include several visits throughout pregnancy. here are some points:

1. **first appointment**: often around 8-10 weeks to confirm pregnancy and establish a baseline.
2. **subsequent visits**: can be monthly or every few weeks in the second trimester.
3. **later pregnancy**: in many places, appointments happen more frequently in the third trimester.
4. **location differences**: some regions have standardized schedules, others vary.
5. **ask a professional**: it’s helpful to check local guidelines or talk to a provider, as different healthcare systems schedule check ups differently.
User: but i read in some places it’s only around 10 visits total, i want to do them right
Assistant: 10 visits might be a common framework in certain guidelines. you might see:

1. **early check**: one visit early to establish care.
2. **monthly checks**: during the middle months.
3. **bi-weekly or weekly**: closer to delivery in some settings.
4. **variations**: some areas or healthcare plans group visits differently.

without knowing your country or local practice norms, it’s best to get a general plan but then confirm with a local obstetrician or midwife.
User: my friend said in her area they only do 4 or 5 visits total, i want to be safe though
Assistant: 4 or 5 visits sounds on the lower side in many places, but every system is different. a few considerations:

1. **risk level**: women with uncomplicated pregnancies might have fewer scheduled visits.
2. **local policy**: some healthcare systems might space appointments out more.
3. **personal preference**: you can talk to your provider about additional visits if you want more frequent check ups.
4. **typical approach**: many guidelines recommend more than 4 or 5 visits in total.

it’s generally a good idea to confirm how often you can or should be seen for prenatal care, based on your location.
User: so how many total check ups do you think i need from the start to the end of the pregnancy
