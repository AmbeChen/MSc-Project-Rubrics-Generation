User: summarize: This is a 4-year-old boy who had multiple ear infections in the past 6 months. An audiometry test was performed on 10/14 showing thresholds at 10dB for frequencies 250Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 4000Hz, and 6000Hz, indicating no hearing deficit. The exam showed no fluid behind the eardrum and no active infection. The boyâ€™s last ear infection was treated 6 weeks ago with no signs of relapse since. The parents want a MyChart message explaining these normal results and any recommended follow-up steps.
