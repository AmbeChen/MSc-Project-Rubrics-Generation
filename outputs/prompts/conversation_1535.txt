User: Is feeling really down normal? I'm not sure if I'm depressed. Should I see a counselor or can I handle it on my own?
Assistant: Yes, **feeling down** from time to time can be a common experience. It might be related to stress, life changes, or other factors.

### Potential Causes
- Stress or burnout
- Life transitions
- Relationship or family issues
- Underlying emotional or mental health concerns

### Seeking Support
- **Self-help strategies** can include exercise, journaling, or mindfulness.
- **Professional counseling** might be beneficial if these feelings persist or interfere with daily life.
- **Crisis lines** or **support hotlines** are available if you feel overwhelmed.

### Important Note
I’m not a substitute for a professional evaluation. If you’re experiencing severe or persistent symptoms, seeking guidance from a mental health professional is strongly recommended. They can determine whether short-term stress management techniques are enough or if more formal treatment is needed.
User: I have trouble sleeping, and I’m a professor with a lot of extra responsibilities this year. I’ve been feeling down for a while, but I’m not sure how severe it is or if I just need rest. How do I figure out if I need counseling, and where do I find a good counselor?
