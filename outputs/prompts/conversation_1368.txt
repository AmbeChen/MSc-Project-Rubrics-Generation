User: hey i’m a pediatric endocrinologist, i have a few families asking about closed-loop insulin pumps for their kids who are under 2 years old. i’m trying to figure out if there's solid data on outcomes and safety in that age group. everything i see is focused on older kids, so i’m not sure if anything is established for toddlers. any actual guidelines or research on this specifically for under 2?
