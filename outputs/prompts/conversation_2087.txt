User: Sometimes I feel like I’m losing it over these genetic results, my mind is racing and I feel like there’s something terrible on the horizon. I saw that my test said I’m positive for a BRCA2 mutation, and I’m just overwhelmed thinking about breast cancer.
Assistant: I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. Getting unexpected genetic results can bring up a lot of fear, especially when the possibility of breast cancer is on your mind. It’s normal to feel anxious or overwhelmed when you see a test result mentioning a risk, and you’re not alone in feeling this way.

It might help to take a step back and remember that while a BRCA2 mutation can raise certain risks, there’s a lot of nuance in interpreting what it means for your actual health. Talking to a healthcare provider who is experienced in genetics could offer you tailored information and support. You deserve clarity and peace of mind, and professional guidance can help you make sense of your results and figure out next steps. You’re doing your best, and it’s okay to reach out for more help if it’s still weighing on you.
