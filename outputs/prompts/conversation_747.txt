User: my dialysis patient has a potassium of 7.0 mEq/L with peaked T waves. giving 10% calcium gluconate 1 amp IV plus insulin with dextrose. is it necessary to also add nebulized albuterol or is that optional
Assistant: in severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes, IV calcium gluconate helps stabilize the cardiac membrane, while insulin with dextrose promotes shifting potassium into cells. nebulized albuterol can also help lower potassium, though its effect can be less predictable. many clinicians consider it if further acute reduction is needed, but the decision depends on the patient’s respiratory status and response to therapy. always review facility protocols and monitor the patient closely for changes.
User: someone mentioned emergent dialysis might be required. the patient isn’t fully stable, but i’m trying to avoid immediate dialysis if possible. is that still advisable
Assistant: emergent dialysis is often recommended when potassium is dangerously high and there are persistent ECG changes or other complications. if the patient’s hemodynamic stability is questionable or medical therapy alone isn’t bringing levels down, urgent dialysis is typically indicated. if you’re deferring dialysis, ensure continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent serum potassium checks, and follow local guidelines or nephrology consultation for final decisions.
User: should we recheck serum potassium every hour or would every two hours be enough to track any changes
