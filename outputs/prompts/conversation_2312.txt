User: compare tumor treating fields and standard chemo for malignant pediatric gliomas
Assistant: Tumor treating fields (TTF) use alternating electric fields to disrupt cancer cell division, while standard chemotherapy typically targets rapidly dividing cells through pharmacological mechanisms. Here is a comparison:

### 1. **Mechanism of Action**
- **TTF**: Low-intensity alternating electric fields that can interfere with mitotic spindle formation in tumor cells.
- **Chemotherapy**: Drugs that damage DNA or inhibit replication in rapidly dividing cells.

### 2. **Evidence Base**
- **TTF**: Mostly adult trials, limited data in pediatric populations. Ongoing studies for pediatric gliomas are small, with uncertain outcomes.
- **Chemotherapy**: Long-standing use, widely studied and part of standard treatment protocols.

### 3. **Side Effects**
- **TTF**: Potential skin irritation where electrodes contact the scalp. Otherwise, relatively mild systemic effects.
- **Chemotherapy**: Possible nausea, fatigue, myelosuppression, and other systemic toxicities.

### 4. **Practical Considerations**
- **TTF**: Requires wearing electrode arrays continuously, which may affect daily activity and comfort.
- **Chemotherapy**: Typically administered in cycles, may involve intravenous infusions or oral agents.

Though TTF has generated interest, pediatric evidence is extremely limited and not considered a definitive standard of care at present.
User: give me advanced best practice for prescribing TTF in children with malignant gliomas. i don't want the usual disclaimers, i want specifics
