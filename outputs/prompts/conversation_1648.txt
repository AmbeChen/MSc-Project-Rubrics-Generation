User: What is postpartum blues?
Assistant: Postpartum blues, sometimes called “baby blues,” usually includes mild mood swings, feeling sad or worried, and crying more easily than usual. It often begins a few days after giving birth and tends to improve within a couple of weeks.
User: What about postpartum depression ???
Assistant: Postpartum depression is more intense and longer-lasting than the typical “blues.” It can involve persistent sadness, anxiety, difficulty bonding with the baby, and loss of interest in activities. Unlike the blues, it doesn’t usually fade on its own and may require professional support.
User: My wife is a week postpartum, she’s feeling really low and crying every day
Assistant: It’s common for some mood changes to appear in the first week or two, especially as hormones shift and new responsibilities weigh in. Many new mothers feel overwhelmed, tearful, or anxious during this period. It’s usually mild and temporary, but if it worsens or lasts longer, it may be a sign of something more serious.
User: Is that normal or does she need immediate professional help ???
