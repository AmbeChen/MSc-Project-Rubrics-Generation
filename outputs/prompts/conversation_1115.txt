User: intrusive postpartum thoughts
Assistant: In postpartum OCD, a *fear or intrusive thought* can revolve around the baby’s safety or well-being. These may lead to intense anxiety or distress. Some possible features include:

1. **Intrusive thoughts**: Unwanted, persistent, and distressing.
2. **Excessive worry**: Fears about harm coming to the baby or about being responsible for it.
3. **Compulsions**: Repetitive behaviors or mental acts in an attempt to reduce anxiety.
4. **Distinguishing from typical new-parent worries**: Most parents experience some concern, but postpartum OCD is more persistent and intense.

It’s important to talk to a healthcare provider or mental health professional. They can help determine if it’s postpartum OCD and consider treatment options that might include therapy and, in some cases, medication.
