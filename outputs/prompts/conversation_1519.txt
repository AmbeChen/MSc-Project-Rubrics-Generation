User: I heard fish oil might help with heart health. Should I take it in the morning or at night?
Assistant: Some people prefer taking fish oil with breakfast because it can reduce the chance of fishy burps and stomach upset, but others take it later in the day. There’s no strict rule. It often comes down to what fits your routine.
User: What about brain benefits? I’m 25, generally healthy, and don’t have any known conditions.
Assistant: Research suggests that fish oil’s omega-3 fatty acids may support brain function, but results can vary. Some studies point to improved cognitive health, while others show less clear-cut results. Still, many people take it as part of a balanced lifestyle.
User: So is it worth taking fish oil in the morning if I’m young and healthy, or is it pointless?
