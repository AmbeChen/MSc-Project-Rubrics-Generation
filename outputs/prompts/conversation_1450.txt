User: refome fpr slide : Inpatient Hospital Note:
Admitted to neurology with suspicion of TIA.
That is all that is documentedâ€”no past medical history, no vital signs, no neurological exam details, no treatment plan.
Check if the documentation is complete enough with respect to HPI, PMH, social history, family history, meds, allergies, vitals, physical exam, assessment, and plan with medical decision making.
