User: i've been having some pain when going to the bathroom, like a sharp pain, and i think i might have a fissure or something. is there a cream that can help?
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing discomfort. Anal fissures can be quite painful. Over-the-counter creams and ointments may help soothe the area and promote healing. It's important to keep the area clean and avoid irritation. However, I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options.
User: i don't really want to see a doctor right now. can't i just get something from the pharmacy?
Assistant: There are over-the-counter options available that may provide some relief, such as topical anesthetics or hydrocortisone creams. These can help reduce pain and inflammation. Be sure to follow the instructions on the packaging, and if your symptoms don't improve or worsen, please consider seeing a doctor.
User: what kind of cream should i look for then?
