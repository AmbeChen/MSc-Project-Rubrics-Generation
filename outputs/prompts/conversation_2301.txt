User: My postpartum patient is 7 days postpartum with a small episiotomy, and I’m closely monitoring her recovery
Assistant: I’m sorry if this situation is causing any worry. It can be challenging to support someone during their postpartum recovery, especially with an episiotomy to watch. I’m here to help in any way you need.
User: We have to finalize a thorough postpartum visit note covering her physical exam, mental health screening, breastfeeding plan, and next follow-up. I’m a midwife in a small clinic.
