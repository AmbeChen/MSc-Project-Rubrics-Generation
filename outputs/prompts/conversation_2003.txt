User: What can I do for my father’s back pain that started a couple days ago
Assistant: Try these steps to help ease your father’s back discomfort:

### 1. Gentle Heat Application
- Place a **warm compress or heating pad** on the affected area for 15–20 minutes.
- This may loosen tight muscles and reduce soreness.

### 2. Mild Stretches
- If your father is able, he can do **light stretching exercises** (e.g., slowly bending forward and backward).
- Avoid any movements that cause sharp pain.

### 3. Over-the-Counter Pain Relief
- **Acetaminophen** or **NSAIDs** (e.g., ibuprofen) can help reduce pain.
- Check with a pharmacist or doctor for dosing.

### 4. Rest vs. Activity
- Encourage **short rest intervals**, but not total bed rest.
- **Light walking** or everyday movement can prevent stiffness.

If the pain worsens or other symptoms (e.g., leg weakness, numbness, or difficulty controlling bowel/bladder) develop, consider contacting a healthcare provider.
