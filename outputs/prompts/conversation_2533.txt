User: I have shortness of breath from time to time, I’m not sure if it’s triggered by physical exercise or if it happens randomly. It usually lasts a few minutes, but sometimes it continues for half an hour or so. I don’t have chest pain or coughing, it’s more like I can’t fully inhale, like I’m missing some air. I visited a local clinic once, they said it might be stress-related. They told me to do some deep nasal breathing, but it didn’t do much for me. I’ve never been told I have asthma or any other condition, so I’m really confused. Could you tell me a breathing technique that can help right away? I’d appreciate any insights.
