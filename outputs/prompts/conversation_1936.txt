User: the way i see it, i got two ways to go about this patient with sudden patchy hair loss
Assistant: it sounds like you’re weighing the benefits of an immediate diagnostic step against observing how the condition evolves
User: maybe i should ask about any recent major stress or if they’ve been pulling at their hair
Assistant: absolutely, exploring lifestyle and psychosocial factors could yield clues
User: i guess i should check for broken hair tips or scalp scaling
Assistant: those are certainly possibilities
User: i think i might be missing something beyond alopecia areata or fungal causes
