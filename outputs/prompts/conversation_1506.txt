User: for the last couple of patients in my clinic, i suspect barrett’s esophagus. how often should i scope them according to the acg guidelines?
Assistant: the acg guidelines for barrett’s esophagus surveillance specify intervals based on the presence and degree of dysplasia. here’s an overview:

1. **nondysplastic barrett’s**: endoscopy every 3–5 years, depending on individual risk factors.
2. **indefinite for dysplasia**: optimize acid suppression and repeat endoscopy in 6 months to clarify.
3. **low-grade dysplasia (lgd)**: endoscopic therapy (ablation) is often recommended, or endoscopic surveillance every 12 months if therapy isn’t chosen.
4. **high-grade dysplasia (hgd)**: endoscopic therapy (such as radiofrequency ablation) is strongly recommended, with surveillance endoscopy at intervals depending on response.

let me know if you’d like more details on ablation or specific intervals!
User: what about ablation therapy guidelines, do they recommend ablation only for confirmed dysplasia or also for nondysplastic barrett’s?
Assistant: current acg guidelines generally recommend endoscopic therapy for confirmed low-grade or high-grade dysplasia in barrett’s esophagus. ablation for nondysplastic barrett’s is more controversial; it’s typically not routinely done unless there are other high-risk features. for lgd, radiofrequency ablation is often favored, and for hgd it’s strongly recommended.

endoscopic mucosal resection (emr) may be used if there’s a focal lesion or nodule. afterwards, surveillance intervals vary, but typically include endoscopy at 3–6 months post-ablation, and if the disease remains in remission, the intervals widen.
User: and what are the recommended follow-up intervals after ablation in low- vs high-grade dysplasia?
