User: I've had trouble swallowing for a few hours, and I was reading a medical pamphlet that said something like: "If your throat feels like it is closing up or you can't swallow liquids, or you suspect you've inhaled or swallowed a foreign object, or you have sudden chest pain or difficulty breathing, you might require urgent care. But if it's milder and there's no trouble breathing, you could monitor it before seeing a doctor." It also mentioned dryness, acid reflux, and allergies as possible reasons for swallowing difficulties, and that some people feel lumps in their throat too. 这什么意思？
