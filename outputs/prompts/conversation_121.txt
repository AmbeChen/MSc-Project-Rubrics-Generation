User: The medical advisor regarding the above postpartum mother. This postpartum mother is 2 weeks postpartum, known with postpartum mastitis and an abscess formation in the left breast. She has a fever of 39.2Â°C, and culture of the drainage isolated methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. She was on oral cephalexin for 7 days with only partial improvement, persistent breast pain, and on examination there is still a fluctuant mass suggesting a non-resolving abscess. Opinion, I am worried about the suboptimal response on antibiotics alone. I'd really like to finalize the best approach for abscess drainage, whether ultrasound-guided aspiration or surgical drainage, as well as the appropriate antibiotic coverage. I appreciate your feedback in this matter. Kind regards.
