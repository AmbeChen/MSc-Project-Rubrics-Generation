User: what does skipping lunch got to do with fainting ???
Assistant: Skipping a meal can cause low blood sugar, which sometimes leads to dizziness or fainting. If someone doesn’t eat for a while, their body may not have enough energy to function properly, and they could pass out.
User: u think we gotta do something if that happens ?? is that correct ??
Assistant: Your question is slightly unclear. A clearer way to phrase it might be:

“Do you think we have to do something if that happens? Is that correct?”
User: my coworker literally collapsed for not eating. do i have to call emergency ???
