User: my grandpa had some trouble talking for a bit stroke
Assistant: Slurred or unusual speech can be caused by several conditions, including stroke. However, it’s difficult to say without more details. Here are some important considerations:

---

1. **Duration and Symptoms**
   - How long did his speech difficulty last?
   - Were there any other symptoms, like weakness or confusion?

2. **Medical History**
   - Does he have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?

3. **Urgency**
   - If there’s any possibility of stroke, it may be an emergency requiring prompt evaluation.

Because stroke symptoms can vary, more information is needed to determine the likelihood. Do you have additional details on his symptoms or how long the episode lasted?
User: he's 72 no other details he seems fine now
Assistant: At age 72, sudden changes in speech could point to a possible neurological event, but there are other possibilities too. Here are some key points to clarify:

---

1. **Exact Duration**
   - Did it last seconds, minutes, or hours?
   - Did it resolve completely?

2. **Associated Signs**
   - Any numbness, weakness, facial droop, or difficulty understanding?
   - Any confusion or vision changes?

3. **Other Risk Factors**
   - Smoking, irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation), or high cholesterol?

If his speech is truly back to normal, it might indicate a transient event, but it’s safest to rule out stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Gathering specifics from him and possibly visiting a healthcare professional for an evaluation would be a prudent next step.
