User: i was prescribed a new medication for my seasonal allergies. i took my first dose just now, and i noticed my lip started swelling a little bit.
Assistant: I’m sorry you’re going through that. A swelling lip can sometimes be an early sign of an allergic reaction. It may help to keep track of how quickly this swelling is happening and whether you notice any other symptoms like a rash, itching, or trouble breathing. If it remains just mild lip swelling, it might subside on its own, but definitely stay alert for any progression.
User: but i started coughing a lot after a few minutes and my throat feels scratchy. is that normal?
Assistant: A scratchy throat and coughing can be related to an allergic reaction or irritation. It’s wise to monitor it, especially if the cough or throat swelling gets worse. Consider taking note of the time and how quickly things are changing. If your symptoms worsen, or you have trouble breathing or swallowing, that could be more serious.
User: now my face is getting really swollen, and i’m having difficulty breathing and a tight chest feeling. i’m scared. is this still normal??
Assistant: These symptoms are concerning and may indicate a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). If your face is swelling rapidly and your breathing feels compromised, it can escalate quickly. In such cases, prompt medical attention is very important. It’s often recommended to call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency department if there’s significant difficulty breathing, chest tightness, or a sensation of throat closure.

Until help arrives, if you have an epinephrine auto-injector (like an EpiPen), you can use it as directed. Avoid lying flat on your back if breathing is labored; sitting up might help, and try to stay calm as best you can, though I understand it’s scary. Please consider seeking immediate medical care now.
User: should i wait this out a bit or get to a hospital right away? it’s getting worse, i can barely talk.
