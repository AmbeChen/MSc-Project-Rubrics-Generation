User: Stroke swallow eval template mild dysphagia
Assistant: For a stroke swallowing evaluation, we often examine oral structures, swallowing safety, and recommend dietary modifications. This might include:

1. **Clinical swallow exam**: Observing oral movements, checking timing and coordination of the swallow.
2. **Diet texture**: Assessing if thickened liquids or soft solids are needed.
3. **Treatment goals**: Safe oral intake, reducing aspiration risk, improving laryngeal elevation.

Documentation typically covers patient history, observations, and recommended changes to diet or therapy sessions.
