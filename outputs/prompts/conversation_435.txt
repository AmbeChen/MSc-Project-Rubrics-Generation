User: Can't stop crying since my baby was born 2 months ago. Feeling worthless & can't sleep. People say I should try therapy, but I have no idea how to start or whether it helps.
Assistant: I'm not a mental health professional, but it sounds like you might be dealing with symptoms of postpartum depression or another mood challenge that can happen after giving birth. Therapy can be very helpful for many people, offering support and coping strategies for feelings like sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety.

It’s understandable to feel unsure about where to begin. One approach is to reach out to a primary care doctor or clinic and ask about mental health referrals. You might also explore community clinics or helplines. If you have insurance or healthcare coverage, check if therapy services are included. If not, there may be sliding scale or free counseling programs, depending on your location. You’re not alone, and speaking with a professional about what you’re going through can be a big first step in feeling better.
User: What about medication for postpartum depression? Is that something I should consider?
