User: If a caller is threatening self harm in a remote area with no local hospital or crisis team is it recommended to do anything besides phone support
Assistant: It sounds like you might be the only help immediately available. In many crisis situations, you could try these steps:

1. Keep the caller on the line and listen actively.
2. Ask if they have a trusted friend or relative nearby.
3. Encourage them to stay safe until professional help can be arranged.
4. See if there’s any emergency services at all in the region you can contact.

If you don’t have direct mental health support locally, staying connected by phone may be the best immediate way to support them.
