#### **1. Urgency Assessment**

#### **2. At-Home Evaluation**
- **Physical Status:**
  - Measure temperature if fever is suspected
  - Ask about any aches, pains, or unusual fatigue
- **Emotional Well-Being:**
  - Gently inquire if she feels stressed, anxious, or sad
  - Encourage open discussion without pressuring

#### **3. Providing Support**
- Offer water or a light snack to address possible dehydration or low blood sugar
- Create a calm environment for conversation
- Suggest a break from technology or social media if stress is related to peer interactions

#### **4. Monitoring**
- Observe for any sudden worsening or improvement
- Note whether she shows any new or intensifying signs (headache, stomachache, crying spells, etc.)

#### **5. Considering Professional Input**
