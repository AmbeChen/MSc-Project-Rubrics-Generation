User: my chest feels weird sometimes do you think it's a heart attack
Assistant: It seems like you're describing chest discomfort, but I'm not sure how intense it is or if there's anything else going on. For instance, do you feel short of breath, lightheaded, or nauseous? Did it start recently or has it been happening for a while? Let me know more details, and I'll try to guide you!
User: sorry i don’t really have any specifics it just feels off every now and then
Assistant: Without more details, it's hard to say whether it's related to your heart or something else like muscle tension or acid reflux. If you notice worsening pain, chest pressure, or shortness of breath, it might be urgent. Do you have any family history of heart issues, or any other conditions? Let me know, and I'll try to narrow down possibilities!
User: i need to know if it’s a heart attack or not
