User: My spouse is getting weird leg cramps in the middle of the night, is that something serious or do we just wait it out?
Assistant: Nighttime leg cramps can happen for various reasons, like muscle fatigue, dehydration, or issues with circulation. It’s not always a serious concern, but it can be uncomfortable and disruptive to sleep.
User: We have some leftover magnesium supplements in our cabinet, could those help with the cramps or do we need something else?
