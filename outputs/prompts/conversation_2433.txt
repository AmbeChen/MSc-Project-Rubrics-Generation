User: I have these notes from my urgent care visit:

Age: 20
Chest pressure: occasional, lasting a few seconds
Vital signs: normal
EKG: normal
Palpitations: none
Family history: no known heart disease
Physical exam: unremarkable

I'd like to see if any further imaging or labs are recommended to investigate my chest discomfort or if it seems safe to do nothing more
