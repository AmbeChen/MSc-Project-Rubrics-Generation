User: How to do the HAS-BLED scoring for a 76-year-old with borderline BP but stable INR? I'd guess 2 or 3 points total
Assistant: A quick way to think about HAS-BLED is to assign 1 point for each risk factor:

```plaintext
H – Hypertension (typically ≥160 mmHg)
A – Abnormal renal/liver function
S – Stroke history
B – Bleeding history or predisposition
L – Labile INR (TTR <60%)
E – Elderly (>65 years)
D – Drugs or alcohol usage
```

In your case:
- Age >65 = 1 point
- Borderline BP might or might not qualify for hypertension (usually needs to be consistently high)
- Stable INR generally means 0 points for labile INR

So that would likely total 2 points, assuming borderline BP is counted and no other factors apply.
User: I want to add 1 point for frequent diet changes because it could cause INR fluctuation. That’d put it at 3, right?
Assistant: Frequent diet changes by themselves don’t automatically count as labile INR. The HAS-BLED item specifically refers to poor time in therapeutic range (TTR <60%). If the INR is stable on your readings, even if the diet is variable, you might not add that extra point.
User: So I’d keep it at 2 then? Or do I go up to 3 if borderline BP eventually rises above 160?
Assistant: If the blood pressure is consistently above 160 mmHg, that’s 1 point. If it’s just borderline and not consistently elevated, that’s typically 0. With stable INR, it’s also 0 for labile INR. So for now, likely 2 total.
User: I’m also mixing up whether the age threshold is 75 or 65. I thought turning 75 might add another point
