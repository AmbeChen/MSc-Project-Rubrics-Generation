Assistant: To improve your sleep quality and fall asleep more easily, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Set a Consistent Bedtime**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily.

3. **Create a Relaxing Environment**: Keep your room dark and quiet.
4. **Unwind Before Bed**: Try reading, gentle stretching, or deep breathing.
