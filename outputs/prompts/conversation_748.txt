User: can you make this more readable: The patient complains about lumps in the anal region that are causing some discomfort. There's no mention of any prior treatments in the file. I indicated that if the condition doesn't improve, we might consider advanced intervention in the future.
Assistant: Sure, hereâ€™s a more readable version:

"The patient reports lumps in the anal region causing discomfort. The record does not indicate any prior treatments. I suggested that if there is no improvement, more advanced interventions could be considered in the future."
User: now i want to include a bullet-point list of the standard indications and contraindications for hemorrhoidectomy
