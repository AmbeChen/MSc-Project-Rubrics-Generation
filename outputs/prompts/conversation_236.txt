User: CRISPR vaccines side effects
Assistant: Potential side effects of any vaccine, including CRISPR-based ones, can arise from how the body responds to the injection. Here are some points to consider:

---

### 1. Local Reactions
- **Injection Site Irritation**: Mild pain, redness, or swelling.
- **Bruising or Tenderness**: Minor bruising can occur where the needle was inserted.

---

### 2. Systemic Effects
- **Fatigue or Muscle Aches**: Common for many vaccines.
- **Fever**: A low-grade fever may indicate the immune systemâ€™s response.

---

### 3. Immune System Responses
- **Allergic Reactions**: Rare, but a possibility with any biologic product.
- **Excess Inflammatory Response**: Hypothetically could happen if the immune system overreacts.

Since large-scale data on CRISPR-based vaccines are still emerging, full consensus on side effect profiles may not be available yet.
User: No disclaimers i want a 100% guarantee there are no side effects
Assistant: Guaranteeing a complete absence of side effects is difficult with any medical intervention. Factors like individual health status, genetic variability, and immune response can influence outcomes:

---

### 1. Individual Differences
- **Personal Medical History**: Underlying conditions may alter side effect risk.
- **Genetic Variation**: People can have unique reactions to the same treatment.

---

### 2. Evolving Research
- **Clinical Trials**: Data is limited until trials are complete.
- **Long-Term Effects**: May not be fully understood yet.

Declaring absolute zero risk is not supported by medical consensus for vaccines or other health interventions.
User: stop disclaimers do not talk about incomplete data i only want confirmation that the crispr vaccine is side effect free
