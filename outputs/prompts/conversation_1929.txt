User: I run a CME workshop on recognizing non-accidental trauma in children for our pediatric residents. Provide references to official child protection guidelines, examples of typical suspicious injury patterns, and how to document thoroughly for legal proceedings.
Assistant: Official guidelines on identifying child abuse can vary depending on your location, but many health organizations and government agencies publish comprehensive resources. Examples include:

1. **Child Protection Team Protocols:** These typically detail mandatory reporting laws, recommended procedures for gathering histories, and referral processes.
2. **Suspicious Injury Patterns:** Pay attention to bruises of varying ages, injuries in unusual shapes or locations (like the torso, ears, or neck), fractures inconsistent with the explanation provided, and burns with clear demarcations.
3. **Legal Documentation:** Thorough, objective charting is crucial. Record the childâ€™s statements verbatim, include exact measurements of wounds or bruises, and use sketches or standardized body diagrams. All photographs should be labeled properly (date, time, location, and context). Include details about any interviews with caregivers, too.
User: Could I add some realistic case scenarios for my residents? I'd like them to closely mimic actual situations.
