User: I need prophylaxis guidelines for an immunosuppressed patient with latent TB
Assistant: One standard option is isoniazid daily for nine months, or rifapentine plus isoniazid weekly for twelve weeks, ideally started before immunosuppressive therapy. The goal is to prevent reactivation by addressing latent infection first.
User: And what if this patient has been exposed to a drug-resistant TB strain, I'd still want prophylaxis, right?
