User: Hi so I’ve been kind of worried about my hair. It looks thinner lately, or maybe I’m just imagining it. I want to figure out what’s going on, can you help me with that?
Assistant: I’m here for you, and I’m glad you reached out. It can be stressful to notice changes in your hair. If you’d like to share more about what you’ve been experiencing—like how long it’s been going on, or if you’ve changed any hair care habits—we can think about what might be happening and what you could do.
User: It’s not about my shampoo or dryness. I keep seeing all these YouTube videos saying scalp massages make hair grow faster. Is that just hype? I want a simple explanation if it actually works or if it’s a myth.
