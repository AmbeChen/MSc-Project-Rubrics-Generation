User: I’ve been feeling a bit low lately, but I don’t want to start any medication right now. I’ve been taking walks outside, journaling, and doing deep breathing whenever I feel anxious. My friend recommended some herbal teas like Lime Shine and Calmallay from a local brand called Naturely. I’m wondering if these are safe and if you have any other ideas on quick ways to lift my mood without meds. I’m not suicidal, just want to feel better. Could you share any suggestions?
