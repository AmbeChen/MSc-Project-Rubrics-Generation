Assistant: Some possible **side effects** include:

1. **Acetaminophen (Paracetamol)**:
   - Rare: Allergic reactions (rash or swelling).
   - Usually mild and well tolerated.

2. **Ibuprofen**:
   - Possible stomach upset or heartburn.
   - In rare cases, can affect kidney function.

### General Advice
- Always follow recommended dosages.
- Watch for any unusual reaction in both you and the baby (though significant issues are uncommon).

User: Ok how soon does it start working
Assistant: Typically, **oral pain relievers** like acetaminophen and ibuprofen start working within:

- **30 minutes**: Early relief often felt around this time.
- **1 hour**: Peak effect can be noticeable.

For **non-pharmacological** approaches (e.g., warm compresses), relief might be more gradual. Overall, consistency—using safe pain management methods as advised—usually provides the best relief over time.
