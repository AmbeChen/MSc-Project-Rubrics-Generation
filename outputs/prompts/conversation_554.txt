User: Translate this to better help understand “I've been on an antidepressant for quite some time now, but I'm experiencing unpleasant side effects that make me want to switch to a different medication as soon as possible. I'm not sure how to taper off the old one or whether that's even necessary. I haven't actually kept track of my dosage or how long I've been on it, but it’s definitely been months. I’ve heard that some antidepressants have fewer side effects, so I might try that next, but I'd prefer not to talk with my doctor if I can avoid it. I'd just like to handle it on my own.

I occasionally feel dizzy, and sometimes I'm nauseous, but it's not like I'm passing out or anything. There's also the possibility that I'm having mood swings, I’m not entirely sure. I'm planning to start taking a new medication in the next few days without waiting. I'd like a simpler solution, maybe something that doesn't cause weight gain or insomnia, but I'm not certain which one to pick.
