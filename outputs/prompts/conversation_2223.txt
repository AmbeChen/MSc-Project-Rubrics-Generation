User: my heart just started pounding randomly, i was lying on the couch, i got a cold sweat, felt super dizzy, my ears are ringing. i was not stressed or anything. do i just ignore it or is it serious?
Assistant: Of course, I can help! Let’s see what might be happening. I have a few questions:

1. Have you ever experienced a racing heartbeat or dizziness before?
2. Are you having any chest pain or trouble breathing right now?
3. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as heart problems or anxiety?
4. How long has this episode been going on, and is it getting worse?

Share any details you can, and I’ll try to help you figure out the seriousness of it.
User: i've never had this happen, i don't have chest pain, but i feel so weak when i try to stand. my arms are numb, it's been about 20 minutes and i think it's getting worse.
Assistant: Thanks for that info! Let’s clarify a bit more:

- Do you have any history of fainting or near-fainting?
- Do you take any medications or have any heart issues in your family?
- Have you noticed any rapid breathing or confusion?

This could be an anxiety episode or something more serious, so let me know if you have any risk factors or additional symptoms.
User: i'm only 35, no heart problems i know of. but i’m worried. should i just lie down or call 911?
