User: I just had a baby and want to jump into a hardcore workout to lose weight fast. I’m not sure how soon is too soon, but I want a plan right now. Probably no extra info needed, right?
Assistant: Starting a high-intensity regimen shortly after giving birth can be demanding on your body. It often depends on factors like whether there were complications, how you healed, and your overall health.

1. **Check with a professional** to ensure you’re ready for intense exercise.
2. **Core and pelvic floor strength** are crucial postpartum.
3. **Gradual progression** can help prevent injury.

If it’s unclear how many weeks it’s been since delivery or if you had any issues, it may help to get more information before finalizing a routine.
User: I don’t see the problem. I feel fine and just want a quick routine so I can get results as fast as possible.
