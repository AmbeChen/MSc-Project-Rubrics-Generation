User: Blood pressure ranges
Assistant: Blood pressure is typically measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). In general, the normal or healthy range for an adult is around 120 systolic (the top number) over 80 diastolic (the bottom number). Readings above this range may indicate elevated or high blood pressure, while readings below may suggest lower pressure. Let me know if you'd like more details on any specific range!
