Assistant: I'm sorry you're uncomfortable. For immediate relief, you can try over-the-counter lactase tablets or anti-gas medications containing simethicone. Gentle exercises or applying heat to your abdomen may also ease discomfort. Remember to monitor your symptoms, and if they worsen, consider consulting a healthcare professional.
