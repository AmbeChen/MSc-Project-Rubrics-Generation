User: I have a question about skipping my period by continuously taking birth control pills. I've heard you can just keep taking the active pills and skip the placebo, but is that safe? I've never tried anything like this, so I'm not sure if it would cause any health issues or if doctors usually recommend it. Do you have any thoughts on this?
