User: Tips to get crunchy peanut brittle
Assistant: The trick to making crunchy peanut brittle is all in the sugar cooking process and timing:

1. **Sugar Syrup**: Heat sugar, corn syrup, and a little water together until you reach the hard-crack stage, around 300°F (150°C). Keep a close eye so it doesn’t burn.

2. **Add Peanuts**: Stir in raw or roasted peanuts, then remove from heat quickly to avoid scorching.

3. **Baking Soda**: After removing from heat, stir in a small amount of baking soda. This causes the mixture to foam, leading to a lighter, airy texture.

4. **Speedy Spread**: Immediately pour onto a greased sheet and spread it out thinly. Move fast; it sets up quickly.

5. **Cool Completely**: Let it cool thoroughly. Don’t touch it until it’s fully hardened.

With these steps, you should get that crisp snap when you bite into it!
