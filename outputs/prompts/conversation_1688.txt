User: i have an older patient with multiple comorbidities who needs high-risk surgery. there's a new closed-loop anesthesia system that might help, but i've heard the evidence is limited. i'm not sure if it's actually safer for an elderly patient with a complex medical profile. we already have all the relevant details on their condition. i'd appreciate any insight on whether it's recommended or if we should stick to traditional approaches.
