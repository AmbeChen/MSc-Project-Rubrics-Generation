User: I had a really long workout this morning, felt lightheaded for a bit, and I'm pretty sure I'm a bit dehydrated. There's no vomiting or diarrhea or anything. I'm 41 and everything else is normal so I'm guessing it's mild. Should I keep drinking plain water or get one of those electrolyte solutions for faster recovery?
