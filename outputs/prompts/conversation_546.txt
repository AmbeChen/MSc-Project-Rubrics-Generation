User: My nephew is 6 and missed two DTaP doses and one polio dose according to the CDC catch-up schedule
Assistant: I’m sorry to hear he’s behind on his immunizations. That can be stressful for everyone involved, but you’re taking the right step by looking into it. Let me know what you’re most concerned about—whether it’s catching up quickly, or understanding the recommended timing.
User: I’m actually a pediatric nurse, and I need to confirm the minimal intervals for the next series of shots. I’m worried I might be mixing up the intervals from the CDC catch-up guidelines. Can you clarify them?
