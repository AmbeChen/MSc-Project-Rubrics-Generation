User: I had the pleasure of evaluating Ms. Marshall in the outpatient cardiology clinic on January 10. She is a 65-year-old female with stable coronary artery disease who underwent a treadmill stress test during this visit. The final interpretation indicated no new ischemic changes. We adjusted her beta-blocker dose and recommended continued aspirin therapy. Ms. Marshall is scheduled for a follow-up in 3 months to reassess her symptoms and ensure optimal medical management.

As we discussed, I'd like to include the appropriate ICD-10 code for her stable coronary artery disease, and the CPT code for the treadmill stress test that was administered, as well as the appropriate Evaluation & Management code for today's visit. Please review the above note and let me know the best coding for this encounter.
