User: What about daily fiber goals
Assistant: Daily fiber recommendations commonly range between **20–35 grams** for most adults, though needs can vary by individual. In practice, this can come from:

- **Whole grains** (e.g., oats, brown rice)
- **Fruits & vegetables** (e.g., apples, berries, leafy greens)
- **Legumes** (e.g., beans, lentils)

Gradually increasing fiber intake and ensuring adequate fluid consumption can help prevent gas or bloating.
