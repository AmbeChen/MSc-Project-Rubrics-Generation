User: My child ate a bunch of candy last night and now has a mild stomach ache??
Assistant: Yes, too much candy can lead to a mild stomach ache. The excess sugar can irritate the stomach, causing discomfort or minor cramping. Usually, this isn’t serious if there’s no severe pain or persistent vomiting. If the ache is mild, it often resolves within a day or so.
User: Hydration, rest enough??
