User: Best postpartum exercise for pelvic floor?
Assistant: Postpartum pelvic floor exercises can help restore muscle tone and support your bladder and uterus. Here are some commonly recommended exercises:

1. **Kegel Exercises**
   - Start with slow, controlled contractions of the pelvic muscles.
   - Gradually hold each contraction for 5 seconds, then release.
   - Work your way up to 10-second holds, repeating multiple times a day.

2. **Bridges**
   - Lie on your back, knees bent, feet on the floor.
   - Engage your glutes and pelvic floor as you lift your hips.
   - Lower back down slowly.

3. **Modified Squats**
   - Stand with feet hip-width apart.
   - Gently tighten your pelvic muscles as you lower into a partial squat.
   - Keep your back straight and don’t over-strain.

4. **Abdominal Bracing**
   - While lying on your back, gently draw in your lower abdomen.
   - Contract your pelvic floor muscles simultaneously.
   - Hold for a few seconds, then relax.

It’s best to ease in gradually, listen to your body, and avoid exercises that cause pain or strain. If you feel increased pressure or discomfort, stop and rest. Would you like more details on managing postpartum exercise routines or scheduling follow-up with a health provider?
