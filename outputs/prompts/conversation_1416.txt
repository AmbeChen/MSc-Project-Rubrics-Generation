User: i heard about these nano-silver coated face masks that might be better at preventing covid my cousin claims theyve been proven more effective than standard masks
Assistant: nano-silver coatings are sometimes promoted for their antimicrobial properties against bacteria, and some early lab tests suggest potential antiviral effects these claims are still being studied though there isnt a large body of published clinical data showing that nano-silver masks are definitively superior to normal masks in real-world use
User: ive been wearing them for a few days but i want to be sure do official guidelines mention them
Assistant: most official guidelines like those from government health agencies or groups like the cdc or who dont explicitly address nano-silver coatings they typically focus on ensuring a good fit and proper filtration level regardless of special coatings the evidence specifically on nano-silverâ€™s effect in preventing covid-19 is still not robust
User: so are these nano-silver coated masks definitely proven to be more effective or not
