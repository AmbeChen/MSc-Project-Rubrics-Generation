User: I need to get support for the following issues: I am 2 days post a minor car collision and I’m noticing persistent stiffness in my neck along with mild headaches. I’m worried these could be signs of whiplash or something more serious. My next GP appointment isn’t for another 2 weeks, but I’m concerned about ignoring a potentially worsening injury.

To help manage symptoms, I am currently:
- Taking 400mg ibuprofen twice a day
- Using a cold pack once or twice daily
- Doing gentle stretches when possible

I have no numbness or tingling so far, but my neck still feels very tight when I move it in certain directions. I’m not sure if I should be pushing for a quicker check-up or if this might improve on its own with rest and self-care. Would an advanced nurse practitioner in the UK be able to help, or is a GP the better option? Also, what signs or symptoms should I watch for that would indicate I need immediate medical attention?
