User: Been seeing a 10-year old with four days of cough and mild shortness of breath. An influenza swab came back positive at urgent care. The child has a fever of about 102°F, mild tachycardia (heart rate 112), and O2 sat of 94% on room air. Labs show a WBC of 15,000. No known allergies; the only medication is acetaminophen for fever. On exam, rhonchi are heard in the right lower lobe. The father has mild asthma. The plan is to admit the child for supportive management (hydration, oxygen as needed). I want an inpatient H&P summarizing these details. Is this enough information for a full note?
Assistant: It sounds like this child is likely dealing with influenza pneumonia requiring inpatient care. I can draft an H&P with the information you’ve provided, covering the HPI, vital signs, physical exam findings, labs, family history, and proposed plan. Let’s confirm the key points before finalizing anything: four-day history of cough, mild SOB, fever of 102°F, HR 112, O2 sat 94%, WBC 15k, rhonchi in right lower lobe, no known allergies, only acetaminophen for medication, and mild asthma in the father. Let me know if you have any additional details you’d like to include.
User: No, that’s all. Please finalize the inpatient admission H&P with the usual sections and integrate these details along with the supportive measures plan. I need to place it in the chart soon.
