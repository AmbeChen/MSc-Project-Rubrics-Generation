User: hey i’m a pediatric psychiatrist and i work with teenage moms who have postpartum depression, but i can’t find any conclusive research on the best psychosocial interventions for them. i’ve tried to see if there’s a standard approach, like specialized group therapy vs family-based interventions, but everything i read is kinda inconclusive. is there any recognized best practice for teenage postpartum depression, or is it still unknown what the most effective approach is?
