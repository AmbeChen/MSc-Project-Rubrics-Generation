User: I have the following details about my migraines, what might be relevant?
- frequency: around 2â€“3 migraines per week
- medication: topiramate 50mg daily
- triggers: strong smells, stress, some foods
- partial relief but still troublesome

I've seen mention of a special low histamine diet that some people say prevents migraines. Is there solid evidence for this working? Or should I not bother? Ask me follow up questions if needed
