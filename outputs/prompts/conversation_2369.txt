User: Hello. I’m a gastroenterologist and it’s new year, so I’m reevaluating different approaches for my patients who have chronic constipation. Lately, a few have asked me about coffee enemas, but from what I’ve read, there doesn’t seem to be much robust data, just anecdotal reports. Are there any official guidelines or high-quality studies on coffee enemas for constipation, and how safe are they? Thanks.
