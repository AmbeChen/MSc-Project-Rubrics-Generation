User: ear's been aching alot for 3 days now, dunno what's wrong
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing ear pain. Earaches can be caused by various issues like infections, earwax buildup, or changes in pressure. Do you have any other symptoms like fever, hearing loss, or discharge from your ear?
User: no fever, but kinda hard to hear on that side. had a flu recently, could that be it?
Assistant: It's possible that your ear pain and hearing difficulty are related to your recent flu. Sometimes, an upper respiratory infection can lead to middle ear infections or cause fluid buildup, affecting hearing. It might help to use over-the-counter pain relievers, but if symptoms persist, you should consider seeing a healthcare professional.
User: should I try any home remedies, or just wait it out?
