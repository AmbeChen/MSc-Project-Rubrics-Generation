User: Explain the main differences between viruses and bacteria. In basic terms, focus on why antibiotics won't help a cold if it's viral.
Assistant: Viruses are tiny infectious agents that need a host’s cells to reproduce, while bacteria are single-celled organisms capable of dividing on their own. Antibiotics are designed to disrupt specific parts of bacterial cells—like their cell walls or protein-making machinery—but viruses don’t have those structures. That’s why antibiotics don’t work on viral infections, such as the common cold.
User: Expand on how viruses invade cells. People say they hijack them, meaning.
Assistant: Viruses attach to a host cell, slip their genetic material inside, and use the cell’s own machinery to make copies of themselves. In other words, the virus takes over the cell’s normal functions and redirects them to produce new viral particles instead of carrying out the cell’s usual tasks.
User: If I do have a viral cold, do I need antibiotics or not?
