User: my father 70 had a slip in bathroom
Assistant: It sounds like your father injured his ankle during that slip. Determining whether it’s a sprain or fracture usually requires an x-ray or medical evaluation. A sprain affects ligaments (the connective tissue around joints), while a fracture is a break in the bone itself. With a fracture, there’s often severe pain, difficulty bearing weight, and possible deformity. With a sprain, pain can vary, but bruising or swelling might be more localized around the joint.

Still, I would strongly recommend you check with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis, especially given your father’s age. They can order an x-ray or other imaging to confirm whether there is a fracture. In the meantime, resting the foot, applying ice, and keeping it elevated might help ease discomfort, but an in-person exam is best.
