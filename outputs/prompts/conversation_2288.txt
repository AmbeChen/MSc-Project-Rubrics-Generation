User: Please write clinical notes. tel apt following visit from Dr. Johansson in Ortho clinic. Pt complains of persistent left knee pain for 2 weeks, worse when walking upstairs, denies locking or giving way. On musculoskeletal exam, the note states left knee with limited range of motion and significant swelling. Then in the next paragraph, the note states left knee is normal, full range of motion, no swelling or effusion noted. X-ray reviewed, no acute bony abnormality. The plan mentions possible MRI if swelling persists, but no mention of the discrepancy. I'd like you to flag any potential documentation errors or conflicting statements in the above note.
