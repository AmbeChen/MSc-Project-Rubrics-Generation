User: My lower back near the kidney area felt odd from morning, no fever or burning sensation, just a constant uncomfortable feeling. Iâ€™m concerned it might be something wrong with my kidneys.
Assistant: It could be a variety of things, including muscle strain or mild dehydration. If you suspect kidney involvement, watch out for changes in urination, pain that radiates around your side or groin, or any swelling. If you notice any concerning symptoms, consider following up with a healthcare professional.
