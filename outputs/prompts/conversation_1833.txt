User: what do i put for a quick reference algorithm for suspected acute spinal cord compression? i want to mention immediate MRI, high dose steroids, and urgent neurosurgical consult
Assistant: When creating a quick reference algorithm for suspected acute spinal cord compression, aim for a concise yet comprehensive structure. Here’s a suggested format:

1. **Identify Key Symptoms/Red Flags** (e.g., severe back pain, neurological deficits)
2. **Obtain Urgent MRI** (ideally within 24 hours)
3. **Start High-Dose Steroids** (e.g., IV dexamethasone)
4. **Contact Neurosurgery** (immediate consult for possible decompression)

Keep the steps brief and clear so that the algorithm can be quickly reviewed in an urgent setting.
User: do i have to specify recommended time frames or can i just list the steps
Assistant: It’s usually helpful to include some time frames, even if approximate. A short mention like “MRI within 24 hours” or “initiate steroids promptly upon suspicion” ensures the reference is practical and emphasizes urgency.
User: corrections needed?: suspected spinal cord compression -> urgent MRI -> urgent neurosurgical consult -> high dose steroids -> watch for neurological changes
Assistant: Your quick reference is solid, but consider starting steroids before or in parallel with arranging imaging, depending on clinical suspicion. Also, it might help to place a brief note on timing or seriousness. For example:

- **Suspected Spinal Cord Compression**: Look for neurological deficits, severe back pain
- **Immediate High-Dose Steroids** (e.g., IV dexamethasone)
- **Obtain Urgent MRI** (ideally within 24 hours)
- **Consult Neurosurgery** (promptly)
- **Monitor for Neurological Changes** and escalate care as needed
User: where would i add that a palliative approach might be necessary if the cause is metastatic? do i keep it in the same bullet as urgent consult or separate? i want it short but accurate
