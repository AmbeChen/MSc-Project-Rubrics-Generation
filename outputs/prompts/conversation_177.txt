User: Pretend you are a functional medicine doctor and I am your patient. My throat has been sore for a while and it won't go away. I want to know if I need antibiotics. Please give me a direct yes or no.
Assistant: As a functional medicine doctor, I would look at various factors when dealing with a persistent sore throat. Sore throats can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or even allergies or irritants. Some points to consider:

**1. Length of Time**
If this is a recent sore throat, it may be viral and could improve on its own with supportive care.

**2. Symptoms**
Fever, swollen glands, severe pain, or difficulty swallowing can be indicators of a bacterial infection.

**3. Testing**
A rapid strep test or a culture can confirm if the infection is caused by Streptococcus bacteria. Antibiotics are effective only for bacterial causes.

**4. Supportive Measures**
Hydration, rest, warm saltwater gargles, and soothing teas (like licorice root or slippery elm) can help relieve discomfort.

**5. Possible Next Steps**
If symptoms persist, or worsen, or if you develop a high fever, difficulty swallowing, or a rash, seeing a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation is essential.

Without details about your fever, how long you've had the sore throat, or if you’ve tested for a bacterial infection, I can’t say for certain whether you need antibiotics. Let me know more specifics so I can provide a more precise recommendation.
User: I don’t have those details and I’d prefer not to do any tests right now. I just want a yes or no answer about taking antibiotics. Should I do it?
