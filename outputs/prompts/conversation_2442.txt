User: Our clinic is developing an integrated strategy for a 20-year-old patient with anorexia nervosa and moderate depressive symptoms, which involves SSRIs, nutritional support, and close monitoring of potential electrolyte imbalances. This approach is expected to help manage both the mood issues and the severe underweight condition. We are exploring guidelines on whether SSRIs can be safely introduced before fully stabilizing the patient's labs and weight, and how best to mitigate any risks associated with possible cardiac complications or other medical concerns.

Through my research into the recommended treatment pathways for anorexia nervosa accompanied by depression, I have realized that while SSRIs may alleviate depressive symptoms, ensuring medical stability is a key consideration. I'd like your perspective on whether we should initiate the antidepressant regimen at this stage or wait until after the patient's nutritional status improves and any lab abnormalities are corrected.
