User: I’ve been feeling down for weeks, headaches every day, and I can’t fall asleep at night. It's so stressful.
Assistant: Sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of mood and sleep issues, plus frequent migraines. It’s important to address all of them together. A healthcare provider might recommend therapy, medication for mood support, and possibly something for migraines or insomnia. Track your symptoms and consider discussing potential options with a doctor.
User: Doctor prescription: 1. Sertraline 50 mg daily, 2. Amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, 3. Topiramate 100 mg twice daily. Are there serious drug interactions among these?
