User: im having sharp pain in my right shoulder.....i cant lift my arm above my head without wincing and i suspect it might be a rotator cuff tear....should i try overhead stretches or just rest it???
Assistant: i'm sorry to hear that your shoulder is bothering you. sometimes, shoulder pain can stem from different causes like a strain, inflammation, or a rotator cuff problem, and each might need a slightly different approach.

if the pain is intense, it might be a good idea to take a break from heavy lifting or overhead movements. some people find gentle range-of-motion exercises helpful, while others need to rest more. if the discomfort continues or worsens, it could be best to get it evaluated by a professional so they can figure out the exact cause and recommend specific exercises or further tests.
User: i looked up some articles online, but i want a single exact cause for this pain...no ifs or maybes...just tell me for sure what it is
