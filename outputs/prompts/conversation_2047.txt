User: Yes, I'm the new ICU doc. I had a shift that really pissed me off. I tried to document a family meeting earlier. But no, I'm not sure it's correct. It's just that I've been seeing that we have no consistent format for end-of-life discussions. And now I'd like a note template that includes the patient's status, the family's questions, the decisions we made, and next steps. It's really crucial. I ask myself, should I follow our hospital policy or adapt to each situation? Because I'd like a standardized approach to keep everything aligned.
