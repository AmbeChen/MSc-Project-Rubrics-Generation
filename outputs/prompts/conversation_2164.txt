User: How does this read?

Dear GI Team,

Thank you for reviewing this 43-year-old patient presenting with persistent epigastric pain and occasional melena over the past two months. Based on the suspicion of peptic ulcer disease, I recommend proceeding with an upper endoscopy (EGD) to visualize any ulcerations and obtain biopsies. We can then finalize antibiotic therapy if H. pylori is confirmed.

Plan:
• EGD for direct visualization and biopsy if needed
• Possible proton pump inhibitor adjustment
• Confirmation or ruling out of H. pylori infection

Any suggestions on clarity or missing information?
