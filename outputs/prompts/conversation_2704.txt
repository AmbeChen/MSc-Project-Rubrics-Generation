User: My sister mentioned something called circadian rhythm, which she says is basically our body's internal clock controlling when we sleep and wake up. What exactly does that mean?
Assistant: The circadian rhythm is a natural, internal process that regulates your sleep-wake cycle and repeats roughly every 24 hours. It's influenced by many factors, especially light exposure, which signals your brain about day or night. When your eyes detect light, it prompts a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus to regulate hormone levels, body temperature, and other functions that help determine when you feel alert or sleepy. This daily cycle helps keep the body’s systems synchronized and functioning optimally.
User: So does that mean if you disrupt it, you can’t sleep properly?
Assistant: Yes, if your circadian rhythm is thrown off, you may experience trouble falling asleep, frequent awakenings at night, or daytime fatigue. Common causes of disruption include jet lag from traveling across time zones, shift work schedules, or even not getting enough exposure to daylight. These factors can confuse your internal clock, making it harder to follow a regular sleep-wake cycle.
User: Is there a way to regulate it and keep a better sleep schedule?
