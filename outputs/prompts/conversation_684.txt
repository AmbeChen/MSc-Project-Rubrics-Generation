User: hi i think there's something weird with my scalp . it's been feeling kinda sore especially when i brush or comb my hair . i want to know if it's normal or if i might have some scalp issue .
Assistant: i’m here to help, and i appreciate you sharing what’s going on . can you tell me more about this soreness ? do you notice any redness or itching on your scalp ? or is it mainly just tender whenever you move your hair around ?
User: there isn’t any rash or itching . it’s more like a dull tenderness that happens mostly when i pull my hair back or brush it . i’m worried i might be damaging my hair or that there's some hidden condition i don’t know about . i could really use some advice .
