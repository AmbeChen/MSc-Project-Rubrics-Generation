User: labs: sputum culture = mycobacterium abscessus, chest imaging = new cavitary lesion.
if i only start clarithromycin monotherapy, is that enough?
whats wrong with my approach
Assistant: monotherapy with clarithromycin alone is usually inadequate for m abscessus, which often requires multi-drug regimens to prevent resistance and improve outcomes.
User: when do we consider hospital admission for this patient
Assistant: hospital admission is typically considered if there's severe pulmonary decline, difficulty managing iv medications or serious side effects such as ototoxicity or intolerable gi issues.
User: if the sputum culture had staph aureus, can i just do standard cf antibiotic protocol
