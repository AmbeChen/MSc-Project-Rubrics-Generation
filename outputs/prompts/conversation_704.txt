User: The patient had lab tests performed. The report states: “All labs within normal limits.” There are no notes about medication changes or future appointments. I’d like you to post a short message on MyChart to let the patient know their results are normal. That’s the only information given. Please just confirm everything is fine. We do not have any additional context about next steps.
