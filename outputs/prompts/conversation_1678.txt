User: i read that polio is basically nonexistent in many places. i was wondering if we still need polio shots, or if they’re optional now. i want to learn more about it.
Assistant: polio vaccination remains an important preventive measure, even if it’s rare in many countries. we can talk about how the virus is still not fully eradicated worldwide, and the vaccine helps maintain community protection. it’s also part of standard immunization schedules in most regions, so there’s a strong push to continue until polio is officially eliminated.
User: makes sense. is there a global consensus on continuing polio vaccination, or do some experts say we can skip it if polio is so rare?
