User: RVSP of 60 mmHg on echo in a scleroderma patient, normal wedge pressure on RHC.
Assistant: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in the context of scleroderma can fall under various WHO groups, most notably Group 1 (PAH) or Group 3 (due to interstitial lung disease). 

**Possible Etiologies**
- **Scleroderma-associated PAH**: Often manifests with a high RVSP (right ventricular systolic pressure) on echocardiography.
- **Cardiac or Pulmonary Causes**: Sometimes confounded by left heart disease, but your mention of normal wedge pressure suggests pre-capillary PH. 

**Potential Diagnostic Considerations**
- **Right Heart Catheterization (RHC)** to confirm hemodynamics: A normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) typically rules out left-sided heart failure.
- **ESC Guidelines**: They outline a comprehensive approach for evaluating scleroderma-associated PAH, including functional testing (6MWT), biomarkers (BNP/NT-proBNP), and imaging.
- **Pulmonary Function Tests**: To quantify concurrent interstitial lung disease.

User: Classification
Assistant: ### **Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension in Scleroderma**

According to the ESC and updated World Health Organization (WHO) groupings:

- **Group 1 (PAH)**: Pre-capillary PH (mPAP ≥ 20 mmHg, PAWP ≤ 15 mmHg, and PVR > 2 Wood units) in the absence of significant lung disease.
- **Group 3**: PH due to lung diseases (e.g., moderate or severe interstitial lung disease). 
- **Group 2**: PH due to left heart disease, generally associated with elevated wedge pressure, which does not appear to be the case here.

In scleroderma, many patients present with Group 1 PAH but some may have combined issues if there is significant interstitial involvement.
