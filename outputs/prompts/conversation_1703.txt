User: i am writing progress notes for my ndis client.

1300- i started my shift and jake was resting on the couch. he had a short nap.
1400- he made a snack of crackers and cheese and watched tv. he smoked outside.
1500- jake told me he is feeling weird ankle pain, but there's no redness or swelling that i can see.
1530- staff asked if he's able to walk or if there's any serious issue.
he's not sure. do i bring him to the hospital to check or do we wait
