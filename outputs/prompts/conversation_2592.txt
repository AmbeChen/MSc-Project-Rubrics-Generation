Assistant: Wearing a seat belt during pregnancy can sometimes feel uncomfortable if it presses against the growing abdomen. Generally:

- **Lap Belt:** Positioned below the belly, across the hip bones. This helps prevent direct pressure on the abdomen.
- **Shoulder Strap:** Should go between the breasts and off to the side of the belly, not cutting across it.
- **Adjust for Comfort:** If the belt is too tight, adjust the seat angle or belt settings.

This arrangement usually offers both comfort and protection. If discomfort persists, discuss it with a healthcare provider.
