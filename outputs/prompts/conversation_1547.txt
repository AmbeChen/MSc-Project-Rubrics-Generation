User: The patient was admitted with upper GI bleed last evening. He has a history of peptic ulcer disease with prior episodes. Endoscopy shows mild erosive changes in the duodenum but no active bleeding. Current labs: Hgb 8.4, platelets 220, INR 1.1. Vitals stable, orthostatics are stable, on IV pantoprazole infusion. No sign of rebleeding overnight. Please write me an inpatient progress note focusing on the effect of the PPI infusion and observing for any recurrence of bleeding.
Assistant: **Inpatient Progress Note (Draft)**

Patient admitted with upper GI bleed... [assistant response continues with a detailed note]
User: Now revise the note to add that the patient will have labs rechecked in 4 hours, and that the recent orthostatic measurements confirm he remains hemodynamically stable.
