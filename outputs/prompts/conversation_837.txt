User: condense to two sentences: 🏥 FREEDOM’s data focusing on revascularization in diabetic patients with multivessel coronary disease suggests CABG might reduce MI risk but raise stroke risk. At 6:00am, the patient was prepped for possible PCI, referencing other major trials. This 63-year-old with diabetes wants the best approach for stenting or surgery. We need to balance stroke vs. MI risk. By the way, any guideline updates?
