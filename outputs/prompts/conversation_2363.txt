User: How do I create an HPI for a 55-year-old male with chest pain that feels stable over the past two weeks?
Assistant: You can start by noting the key elements of the chest pain. For example, include its duration (two weeks), character (pressure, tightness, or heaviness?), and how it behaves with exertion or rest. You could also note any pertinent negatives like no palpitations or no recent fevers.
User: how do i also mention normal troponins and a normal ecg in the hpi
Assistant: You can add a statement indicating that recent workup showed normal cardiac enzymes (troponins) and a normal ECG. For instance:

```
Recent laboratory tests include normal troponin levels. A 12-lead ECG shows normal sinus rhythm without ischemic changes.
```
User: Im seeing an error in the EHR saying 'incomplete doc'
Assistant: This might refer to missing important elements of the history, such as family history of cardiac disease. The EHR often wants details like whether there’s a family history of coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.
User: ok father had early cad, mother healthy so maybe i should add that
Assistant: Yes, you can include it like this:

```
Family History:
• Father: Diagnosed with CAD at age 50
• Mother: No known cardiac or chronic illnesses
```
User: one of our favorite disclaimers is no known drug allergies can you add that
Assistant: Sure. You can append:

```
Allergies: No known drug allergies
```
User: i still see an error about missing associated symptoms
Assistant: Try specifying the presence or absence of shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, or other relevant associated symptoms. For instance:

```
Associated Symptoms:
• Denies shortness of breath, palpitations, or GI disturbances.
```
User: ok so now i have chest pain stable 2 weeks normal troponin normal ecg father had cad no known drug allergies denies sob or gi issues
Assistant: That’s a good summary. You might also want to specify the quality of the pain (e.g., pressure-like, burning, stabbing) and whether it improves or worsens with rest.
User: i added that it is a pressure-like sensation in the mid chest that’s unchanged by rest
Assistant: Great. That detail helps clarify the nature of the pain.
User: here’s my final hpi:
1) 55-year-old male
2) 2 weeks of stable chest pain
3) father had cad at 50
4) normal troponins & ecg
5) denies sob or gi issues
6) no known drug allergies
are we missing anything else for chest pain documentation?
