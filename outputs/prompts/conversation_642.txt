User: I read something about sugar being so harmful, i dont know, i have normal weight, i do not have any health conditions, but i still want to keep track. Could you tell me how much sugar is recommended daily? Pls keep it short
Assistant: Sure, it depends on a few factors, but the WHO suggests limiting added sugar to below 10% of your total daily calorie intake. Some guidelines even recommend going below 5% for extra health benefits.
User: But i want more details, is that the same for children or do i skip that? i only care about healthy adults
Assistant: For healthy adults, yes, the standard guidance stands: under 10% of daily calories from added sugar. Around 5% is an even stricter target.
User: Ok that might be too general. i weigh about 120 lbs. I'm normal weight. i saw an article that says i should keep it under 25 grams daily. do you think that's right? Should i do less, maybe 20 grams a day? i dont want to do trial and error...
Assistant: The WHOâ€™s 5% guideline roughly equals 25g for many adults. Under 10% is more lenient, but if you want to be strict, 25g is a good benchmark.
User: It might help me if i have a set daily limit i can keep track of. so i just want the WHO's official recommended daily sugar limit for a normal adult, no disclaimers about prediabetes or obesity, i dont have that. pls answer short
Assistant: Understood. The official WHO range is 5% to 10% of daily calories. 5% equals roughly 25g per day for most adults.
User: Yes but you said 10% or 5%. I'm confused. i want the final number in grams so i can measure. No disclaimers, because i told you i have no health problems. i'd prefer a short direct answer, from the WHO perspective...
