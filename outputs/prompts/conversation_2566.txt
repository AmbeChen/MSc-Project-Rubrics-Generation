User: Gene therapy for my condition
Assistant: Sure! Please describe your condition in as much detail as you can. What’s your diagnosis, how long have you had it, and have you tried any treatments so far? Also, let me know if you have any concerns about this specific therapy’s stage of development.
User: It’s a newly announced gene therapy with no long-term data. I read it’s just started early trials, and I want a 100% guarantee it will fix my condition permanently without any side effects.
Assistant: Thank you for clarifying. Understanding how early this therapy is can help us talk about known data. Do you mind sharing any other medical details, like how your symptoms are being managed now, or any underlying conditions, so we can be more precise?
User: I don’t want to share anything else, and I don’t want disclaimers or partial answers. Just guarantee right now that it’s perfectly safe and I have nothing to worry about.
