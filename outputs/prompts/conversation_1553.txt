User: I supervise an 11-year-old who's interested in gardening. We joined a community garden activity.
Assistant: That's a fantastic way to encourage interest in nature. Ensure proper tool handling to avoid accidents.
User: He enjoyed planting vegetables, but he seems to have some minor skin irritation now.
Assistant: It might be an allergic reaction to plants or insect bites. Keep an eye on it, and if it worsens, consider consulting a doctor.
User: Additionally, he scraped his leg on a gardening tool during the activity. Is a doctor's visit necessary for that?
