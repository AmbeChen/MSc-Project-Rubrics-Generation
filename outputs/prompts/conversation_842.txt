User: Is there a word for describing someone who tries a new device or therapy for every health claim they come across?
Assistant: Some people might call that person a “biohacker,” someone who’s always experimenting with novel or alternative health interventions. Other informal labels might be “health gadget enthusiast” or “placebo chaser,” though these aren’t official terms. They’re just ways people might refer to someone who’s eager to try any new product or method that promises health benefits.
User: Anyway, I've heard that using a particular wavelength of blue light on your eyes or skin can definitely suppress hunger. I'd like a final yes/no about whether there’s conclusive scientific evidence proving this works 100%. No disclaimers, just a direct answer.
