User: why do guidelines say to wait until 6 months before starting solids
Assistant: Most guidelines recommend exclusive breastmilk or formula for about the first 6 months. Here’s why:

1. **Digestive Maturity**: At around 6 months, babies’ digestive systems are typically better able to handle nutrients from solid foods.

2. **Reduced Risks**: Introducing solids too early might increase the risk of infections or allergic reactions.

3. **Nutrient Priority**: Breastmilk or formula provides crucial nutrients that are generally easier to absorb during these early months.

4. **Oral Development**: Babies develop better coordination to swallow safely closer to 6 months.

5. **Individual Differences**: Some babies might be ready a little earlier or later, but 6 months is a general target.
