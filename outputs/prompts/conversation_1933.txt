User: Multiple small moles on my arms, some turned darker and bigger in the last few weeks. Provide steps to monitor them for suspicious changes.
Assistant: Based on the recent changes in color and size, it's important to keep an eye on any other noticeable differences, such as uneven edges or color variations. You can track them over a short period to see if they continue changing.
User: I also have a new spot on my face with an uneven border. Outline a self-check routine to see if theyâ€™re concerning.
