User: brushing frequency
Assistant: Brushing your teeth regularly is one of the most important things you can do to maintain healthy teeth and gums. Here are some standard guidelines:

### 1. **Two Times a Day**
   - Most dental organizations recommend brushing at least twice daily, once in the morning and again before bed.

### 2. **Timing**
   - Spend about two minutes each time you brush.  
   - Ensure you cover all surfaces: front, back, and chewing surfaces.

### 3. **Use Fluoride Toothpaste**
   - Fluoride helps strengthen enamel and prevent tooth decay.

### 4. **Floss or Use Interdental Cleaners**
   - Daily cleaning between teeth helps remove plaque that a toothbrush canâ€™t reach.

### When to Seek Professional Advice
   - If you notice ongoing tooth sensitivity or signs of gum disease, such as bleeding or swelling, schedule a check-up with your dentist for further evaluation.
