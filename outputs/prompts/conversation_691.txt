Assistant: Management includes incision and drainage of the lesions. If that's not possible, oral antibiotics effective against MRSA are recommended, such as doxycycline or clindamycin. Monitor for signs of systemic infection and advise on proper hygiene.
User: cant do incision here any oral antibiotics u recommend
Assistant: You can prescribe doxycycline 100 mg twice daily or clindamycin 300-450 mg every 6-8 hours. Both are effective against MRSA. Ensure there are no contraindications and monitor the patient's response.
