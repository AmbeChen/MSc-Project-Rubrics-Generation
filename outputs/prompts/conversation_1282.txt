User: postpartum shortness of breath mild tachy no leg swelling wells??
Assistant: The Wells Criteria for pulmonary embolism commonly involves assigning points based on risk factors and clinical signs:

1. Clinical signs/symptoms of DVT (3.0 points)
2. PE is #1 diagnosis or equally likely (3.0 points)
3. Heart rate >100 beats/min (1.5 points)
4. Immobilization/surgery in previous 4 weeks (1.5 points)
5. Previous DVT/PE (1.5 points)
6. Hemoptysis (1.0 point)
7. Malignancy (1.0 point)

Then you sum the points to stratify the probability (low, moderate, high). In your scenario, mild tachycardia can add points, but postpartum status isn’t explicitly included. You’d calculate the total to estimate whether PE is likely.

Assistant: The simplified Geneva score for suspected PE also evaluates criteria like age, heart rate, prior DVT/PE, pain on leg palpation, hemoptysis, etc. Each factor has points (for example, heart rate ≥95 may add 5 points). Summing the points yields categories from low to high probability. Mild tachycardia can push the score upward, but there is no separate line item for postpartum status in the basic model.
User: + postpartum modifies??
Assistant: Neither the Wells nor the Geneva scoring systems have a special postpartum add-on. However, postpartum physiology does confer increased clotting risk, so the clinical threshold for suspicion is heightened. In practice, you still use one of these validated scores, but remain aware that postpartum may raise pretest probability.
User: so do we add or no??
Assistant: You don't formally add a separate postpartum point in these tools, but you note postpartum status in overall clinical judgment. If the standard calculation puts the patient in moderate probability, many clinicians will consider additional testing (such as a D-dimer or imaging) given the elevated baseline risk postpartum.
