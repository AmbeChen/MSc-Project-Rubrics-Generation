User: please highlight : I have a note for a 50-year-old patient with mild dehydration . the medication admin record says the patient is on D5W at 60 ml/h . meanwhile the plan section states normal saline at 100 ml/h . I'd appreciate your help clarifying if there's any mismatch in intravenous fluids here . the rest of the note is unremarkable . your input is appreciated
