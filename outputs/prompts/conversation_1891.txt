User: What is a scab
Assistant: A **scab** is a protective crust that forms over a wound or sore during the healing process. When your skin is injured—like from a cut, scrape, or scratch—your body works to stop the bleeding and protect the area. Platelets in your blood help form a clot, and as it dries, it becomes a scab.

Scabs have several important functions:

1. **Protection** – They create a barrier against bacteria and dirt, helping prevent infection.
2. **Healing** – A scab keeps the wound moist underneath, which supports skin tissue repair.
3. **Temporary cover** – As new skin grows, the scab eventually falls off on its own.

It’s generally best to leave a scab alone so it can do its job, although keeping the area clean and covered if necessary can promote faster healing.
User: I see some weird lumps on my arms, kinda crusted over, and I’m worried maybe it’s monkeypox. I haven’t traveled anywhere or been around sick people, so I’m not even sure if we get monkeypox here. Do I need a vaccine or to get tested or what?
