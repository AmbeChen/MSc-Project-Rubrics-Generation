Assistant: Certainly. Here is the summary in a formal style:

Infants typically require feeding every two to three hours, allowing flexibility based on individual cues. Overfeeding may lead to fussiness when excess air is swallowed. Employing gentle burping techniques helps relieve discomfort. Pediatric guidelines often endorse responsive feeding, where caregivers watch for signs of hunger. In this approach, babies receive nourishment without strict schedules. Mild regurgitation, or spit-up, is frequently regarded as a normal occurrence in healthy infants.

Sleep varies: some newborns rest for long stretches, others awaken more often. Pediatric experts recommend short, soothing activities after meals to improve bonding and digestion. A supportive emotional environment can foster better feeding patterns.
