Hi Dr. Casey,
Iâ€™m finalizing the discharge medication plan for a patient who just had a total knee replacement. We need to confirm the recommended prophylaxis approach: LMWH or a DOAC? Also, I read that it's typically 14 days, but do guidelines recommend extended prophylaxis if they have Factor V Leiden?
Warm regards,
Dr. Taylor
