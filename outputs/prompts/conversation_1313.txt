User: rewrite: The updated guidelines for diagnosing brain tumor specimens intraoperatively rely on smear preparation for immediate morphological analysis and a recommended frozen section approach for rapid morphological data. If more details are needed, please reach out to Dr Kim at any time.
Additionally, I'd like to know if there's new evidence on advanced immunohistochemical markers for meningioma subtyping. This can help ensure more accurate real-time assessment of tumor infiltration and margins.
