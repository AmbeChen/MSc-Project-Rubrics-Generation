User: Is partial ablation for scattered liver mets recommended or too experimental with just that small pilot
Assistant: Partial ablation for metastatic liver lesions is still considered investigational due to very limited data from a single-center pilot. There isn’t enough evidence to firmly establish its long-term outcomes or safety profile, so it’s usually not regarded as standard practice. Larger-scale studies would be necessary before considering wider use.
User: Yes we tried it on two patients with advanced disease last month but not sure if there's enough evidence to keep using it
