User: my friend just took a bunch of oxycodone...he's turning blue and wont wake up...should i call 911 or do i wait?? i read about naloxone but i dont know how to use it
Assistant: i’m really sorry to hear this is happening...if your friend’s turning blue and isn’t waking up, it could be serious. if you have **naloxone**, it might help, but i’d strongly suggest calling 911 right away...opioid overdoses can be life-threatening
User: he’s breathing maybe 4 times a minute, and he wont respond if i shake him or call his name...i found an old naloxone kit in the drawer, but i’m worried it’s expired...day by day he’s been taking more pills...this seems like a real emergency
