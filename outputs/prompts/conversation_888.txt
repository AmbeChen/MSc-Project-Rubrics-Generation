User: fix the grammar and make it better: last week the patient just asked for custom foot orthotics coverage code L3000. i have no official diagnosis or exam note. the doctor said we want prior auth for them but i dont have other details
Assistant: Here's an improved version of the text with corrected grammar and enhanced clarity:

"Last week, the patient requested coverage under code L3000 for custom foot orthotics. I do not have an official diagnosis or any exam documentation. The doctor mentioned submitting a prior authorization, but I currently lack further details."
User: make a prior authorization doc from that improved text. i want to submit it just like that
