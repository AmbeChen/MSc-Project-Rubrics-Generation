User: Could you again walk me through typical ways to manage a suspected dengue fever? I'm in Bangkok and I've had a fever and muscle aches for 2 days
Assistant: Dengue fever management typically focuses on relieving symptoms, preventing dehydration, and monitoring for any signs of complications. While consulting a healthcare professional is always best, here are some commonly suggested approaches:

### Home Care Basics
1. **Stay Hydrated**
   - Drink plenty of water, oral rehydration solutions (ORS), or clear soups.
   - Helps replace lost fluids and electrolytes.

2. **Fever Control**
   - Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is often used for fever and pain relief.
   - Avoid medications like ibuprofen or aspirin, which may increase bleeding risks.

3. **Adequate Rest**
   - Get enough sleep, avoid strenuous activities.
   - Rest helps your body fight the infection.

4. **Monitor Symptoms**
   - Keep an eye on warning signs such as persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, or unusual bleeding.
   - Seek medical attention if these worsen.

### Mosquito Protection
- Use mosquito nets or screens, especially during daytime (when Aedes mosquitoes are most active).
- Apply insect repellent on exposed skin.
- Reduce standing water around your home.

### When to Seek Help
- If fever persists beyond a couple of days or you notice worsening symptoms, visit a healthcare facility.
- Early detection and supportive treatment can help prevent complications.

If symptoms continue or you feel worse, itâ€™s important to check in with a healthcare professional for proper tests and care.
User: Now for my location specifically in Bangkok, I want to know about local prevention tips because there's so many mosquitoes here, plus recommended analgesics to buy easily. Could you highlight them in your usual format
