User: What should I do?

Current situation: I'm a nurse on a hematology floor caring for a 19-year-old with sickle cell disease who was admitted for severe pain. A few minutes ago they developed chest pain and difficulty breathing, and their oxygen saturation dropped to 83%. I'm really worried about acute chest syndrome because they're looking worse by the minute.
