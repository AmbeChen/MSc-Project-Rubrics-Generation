User: Best remedy for itchy red rash
Assistant: Finding relief for an itchy red rash can depend on its cause. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Clean the Area
- Gently wash the skin with mild soap and water
- Pat dry instead of rubbing

### 2. Apply Topical Relief
- Use a fragrance-free moisturizer or mild over-the-counter anti-itch cream (e.g., hydrocortisone)

### 3. Avoid Irritants
- Try not to scratch or pick at the rash
- Keep the area cool and dry

### 4. Seek Professional Advice
- If it worsens or does not improve, consult a healthcare provider for an evaluation

Let me know if there is a specific kind of rash or any other details you can provide!
