User: My partner has had a persistent headache for the past two days, and it seems to be getting more intense. They've also mentioned episodes of blurred vision, which come and go every few hours.


- headache for about 2 days, growing in intensity

- sudden bursts of blurred vision

- worried it might be something like a migraine or higher pressure in the head


They have an appointment with their GP in a few days, but I'm concerned it might be something urgent. I appreciate this is for information only, I won't tell them what to do, I'm just really curious about how serious this could be but feel awkward asking them more.
