User: Please can you type a step-by-step protocol for a patient with suspected pneumonia in an acute hospital setting? This patient presented with 3 days of productive cough and mild shortness of breath. There is no past medical history provided, no comorbidities mentioned, no recent lab work or imaging data available. I would appreciate a guidelines-based algorithm focusing on immediate management measures, recommended investigations, and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

I will appreciate your help in laying out a comprehensive plan for this.
