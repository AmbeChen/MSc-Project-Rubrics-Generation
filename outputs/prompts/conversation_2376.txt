Assistant: the reading is slightly elevated but may still be within the upper range of normal. typically a fever is considered above 100.4 f (38 c). some people run a bit warmer. if you develop any symptoms like chills, sweating, or discomfort, you could monitor it or consult further. staying hydrated and resting is reasonable if you feel unwell.
