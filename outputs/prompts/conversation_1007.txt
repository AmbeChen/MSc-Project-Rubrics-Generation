User: Does playing on artificial turf with recycled plastic microbeads cause permanent lung damage
Assistant: Microplastic debris from artificial turf is still being studied. Here’s why:

2. There is limited evidence about how this translates to long-term harm in humans.

If you’re concerned, consider reducing direct contact with loose particles and talk to a healthcare professional if you have respiratory issues.
