User: Hi Mam,
I had a hair test for heavy metals on March 15 with borderline results for lead and mercury. I read online that bentonite clay baths can flush out these toxins but the sources are contradictory. Some people claim there's evidence, but I'm not sure if there's real proof. My mother took clay baths daily last year and swears it helped her.
I don't plan on seeking further tests or specialist opinions, I'm simply worried about these borderline levels. I'm a vegetarian but eat cheese and yogurt to get protein. Is it scientifically proven that clay baths detox heavy metals, or is it not backed by research? I'm confused. how can I contact you.
