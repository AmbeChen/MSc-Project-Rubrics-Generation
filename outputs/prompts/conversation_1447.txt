Assistant: Comparing pediatric vaccination schedules in the **US**, **UK**, and **Australia** typically involves similar core vaccines but with some variations:

1. **MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)**
   - **US**: Commonly given at 12–15 months, then a second dose at 4–6 years.
   - **UK**: Given around 12 months, with a pre-school booster at about 3 years 4 months.
   - **Australia**: First dose near 12 months, then a second dose at around 18 months (in many states combined as MMRV).

2. **Varicella (Chickenpox)**
   - **US**: Typically given at 12–15 months, then a second dose at 4–6 years.
   - **UK**: Historically reserved for special risk groups, but it may now be offered more broadly. Still less routine than in the US.
   - **Australia**: Often included with MMR as MMRV at 18 months, plus a separate dose or schedule variations depending on state guidelines.

3. **Meningococcal**
   - **US**: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine around ages 11–12, with a booster at 16.
   - **UK**: Introduced earlier in adolescence (13–15), with infant/toddler MenB in certain schedules.
   - **Australia**: Depending on region, it may be provided in adolescence or earlier if risk factors exist.

Each national health agency tailors its schedule based on epidemiological data and public health objectives, so while the core principle is preventing childhood infections, timing and combinations may differ to optimize coverage and reduce missed opportunities.
