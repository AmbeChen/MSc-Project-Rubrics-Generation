User: hey i recently went on a long hike and now i have some mild knee pain, i want to know which over-the-counter meds might be safest for me, act as a medical adviser to help me decide
Assistant: thanks for letting me know, i can help guide you on finding some relief for mild knee pain. before i suggest possible otc medications, can you tell me:

1. when did the discomfort start, and do you recall any specific incident during your hike?
2. do you have any known health issues, like stomach problems, allergies, or heart conditions?
3. have you tried any medication so far (like ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen) and did you notice any relief?
4. are there any other symptoms, such as swelling, redness, or stiffness in your knee?

once i know a bit more, i can discuss some of the common otc pain relievers and strategies for helping you feel better.
User: the pain started the day after the hike, it hurts most when i put weight on that leg. i don’t have any major health issues i know of, but ibuprofen makes my stomach feel weird. i haven’t tried anything else yet. which over-the-counter meds are best and safest for me right now?
