User: Interpret these observations in laymans terms:  Wife got a bruise on her elbow after a minor fall while hiking 10 days ago. It's small, not swollen, color is fading from purple to yellowish. She says there's no severe pain or fever. Should she worry about urgent care?
Assistant: In simple terms, it sounds like a normal bruise that’s healing well. Usually, bruises go through a cycle of changing colors as they heal—from purple or blue to greenish or yellowish. With no severe pain or fever, it’s unlikely that there’s a serious infection. But of course, if any new symptoms like swelling, redness, or worsening pain appear, then it might be worth checking with a healthcare professional.
User: Interpret these findings:

The bruise is stable with no new symptoms, and it’s gradually improving.

History: My wife is 43 with no known bleeding disorders. She can move her arm normally. Are we okay waiting a bit longer to see if it fully heals or do we need to call urgent care now?
