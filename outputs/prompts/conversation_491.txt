User: Are postpartum checkups for twins different in Denmark, or is it the same schedule as with singletons?
Assistant: Yes, postpartum care for twins can differ in Denmark. For instance:

1. More frequent checkups to monitor both babies’ growth.
2. Additional screenings to ensure both infants are feeding well.
3. Specialized midwife or health visitor support to manage potential challenges like fatigue.

Some families with multiples receive extra home visits from healthcare professionals. If you’re unsure, it’s best to talk to your midwife or doctor about local Danish guidelines.
User: I’m in Copenhagen, and I just delivered twins last week. Could you please outline the typical postpartum visit schedule recommended here for twin births? I’d like to know how many checkups to expect and at which intervals.
