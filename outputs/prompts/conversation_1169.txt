User: He is adult, i found him in my office. not sure how to do cpr
Assistant: For an adult who is unresponsive and not breathing, beginning CPR can help maintain blood flow and oxygen until help arrives. Start as soon as possible.
User: I forgot the steps completely
Assistant: That’s okay, basics are usually 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths. Push hard and fast in the center of the chest.
User: No special conditions or injuries, just normal cpr?
Assistant: Yes, if there’s nothing else complicating matters, standard adult CPR guidelines apply. Keep compressions about 2 inches deep, at 100-120 per minute, on a firm surface.
