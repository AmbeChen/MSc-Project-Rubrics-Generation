User: Am finishing my operative note for an emergency splenectomy on a 37-year-old with a severe spleen laceration from a car crash, used an open approach with a midline incision, EBL about 350 ml, the patient was stable with no major complication, now planning to keep them in ICU for a day to watch for bleeding and check labs, how do i phrase it all in the official format
