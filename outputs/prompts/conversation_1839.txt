User: appendicitis vs mesenteric lymphadenitis
Assistant: Appendicitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis can present with similar right lower quadrant abdominal pain, but they differ in etiology and clinical features.

### Appendicitis
- **Cause**: Inflammation of the appendix, often due to obstruction.
- **Symptoms**: Periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, nausea, low-grade fever.
- **Exam Findings**: Rebound tenderness, guarding, positive Rovsingâ€™s sign.
- **Complications**: Risk of perforation, abscess formation.

### Mesenteric Lymphadenitis
- **Cause**: Often triggered by viral infection.
- **Symptoms**: Similar abdominal pain, but typically less severe.
- **Exam Findings**: Less likely to have overt peritoneal signs.
- **Clinical Course**: Often self-limiting, managed with supportive care.

### Distinguishing Factors
- **Lab Tests**: Elevated WBC common in appendicitis, but can also be mildly elevated in infections.
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound first-line for suspected appendicitis; CT or MRI if inconclusive.

### Conclusion
Mesenteric lymphadenitis can mimic appendicitis. Careful clinical evaluation, labs, and imaging can help differentiate the two. If appendicitis is suspected, prompt surgical consultation is recommended.
