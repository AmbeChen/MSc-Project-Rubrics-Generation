User: I’m a sports medicine doc with several patients who have chronic tendon issues & I keep coming across conflicting research on platelet-rich plasma injections. The smaller studies show different outcomes & I don’t see any larger systematic reviews. Are there established guidelines or conclusive evidence that PRP is beneficial for these long-term tendon problems?
