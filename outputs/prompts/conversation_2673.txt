User: which cooking oil is better for daily home cooking
Assistant: Choosing a cooking oil often depends on factors like smoke point, flavor, and potential health benefits. Here are a few commonly recommended options:

1. **Olive Oil (Extra Virgin):** Rich in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, suitable for low to medium-heat cooking.
2. **Canola Oil:** Has a relatively high smoke point, low in saturated fat, and good for saut√©ing and baking.
3. **Avocado Oil:** High smoke point, neutral flavor, a good source of monounsaturated fats.
4. **Sunflower Oil (High Oleic):** Also has a high smoke point and a neutral taste, making it versatile.

The choice may also be influenced by personal preference and availability.
User: does using olive or canola oil help with portion control
Assistant: Portion control is more about measuring how much food you eat rather than the type of oil you use. While some oils are considered healthier options, they still contain calories, so using any oil in moderation is key. A teaspoon or tablespoon can help measure oil amounts to avoid accidentally using too much.

"Protein 50-70g/day"
not sure how to measure them at home. i'd like a basic portion guide
Assistant: A practical method to start with is to compare portions to common objects or your own hand, for example:

- **Carbs**: About the size of a cupped handful of rice or pasta per serving. Bread slices can be portioned by thickness.
- **Protein**: Roughly the size of your palm (thickness included) for meat, poultry, or fish.

Using measuring cups or a kitchen scale can be more precise, but hand-based approximations are a helpful beginner guide.
