User: How quickly. Will electromagnetic field therapy shorten healing in persistent nonunion
Assistant: Electromagnetic field therapy has been studied for fracture nonunions, but results vary. Here are some points:

### 1. Small-Scale Findings
- Certain pilot studies reported a few weeks of faster healing compared to non-stimulated fractures.

### 2. Proposed Mechanism
- The idea is that electromagnetic fields may encourage cellular processes involved in bone formation.

### 3. Variation by Fracture Type
- Fracture location, severity, and overall patient health can influence results.

### 4. Limited Standardization
- There isnâ€™t full consensus on the frequency, duration, and intensity of therapy that works best.

### 5. Gap in Long-Term Data
- Some studies indicate subtle benefits, but large, definitive trials are lacking to establish a precise healing timeline.
