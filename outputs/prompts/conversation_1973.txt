User: From january to september 2023, I have observed more parents requesting herbal remedies like echinacea, elderberry, or traditional teas for treating their children's colds. Although many families cite anecdotal experiences, they often do not have access to evidence-based guidance from pediatric or family medicine sources. A comprehensive overview is needed to address efficacy, dosage (if established), and any safety or interaction concerns, backed by credible references.
