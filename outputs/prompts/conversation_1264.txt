User: What is a function in math
Assistant: In math, a **function** is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. More formally, for every element \(x\) in the domain, there is a unique element \(f(x)\) in the codomain. Functions help describe relationships between quantities, and they can be represented in various ways, like equations, tables, or graphs.
User: I've been having severe, sharp pain in my lower right abdomen, plus fever and vomiting. I'm worried it might be appendicitis, but I'm way out in a remote area and can't get to a hospital quickly. Can I just wait a day to see if it settles down, or do I need to find help right now
