User: Hey,
My spouse is freaking out about this small shallow cut I got on my forearm from moving some boxes around. I cleaned it up with soap and water, it's not bleeding anymore, and there's no redness or weird discharge. I'm not allergic to any antibiotic creams either. Do you think it's safe to just apply an over-the-counter antibacterial ointment and put a bandage on it, or should I be doing something else? I'm kinda worried I'll mess it up if I keep a bandage on all day, but also worried if I don't. I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks.
