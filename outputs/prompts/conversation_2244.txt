User: I’ve been tracking my blood pressure at home every morning for the last six months. It usually averages around 145/90. I take a low-dose ACE inhibitor every day at 7 a.m., and I’ve cut salt way down to under 2 grams daily, plus I eat bananas and leafy greens for potassium. I also do a 30-minute workout five times a week. Should I just continue with the same medication, or do I need to add a new one?
Assistant: Based on your BP logs and your current routine, it sounds like you have a solid approach in place. Your readings average a bit above the typical target for hypertension management, which is often aiming for under 130/80 (though it can vary depending on factors like age and overall health). If your readings have only modestly improved or plateaued, it may be worth discussing an adjustment with your doctor.

Some people benefit from combining an ACE inhibitor with a different drug class (like a diuretic or calcium channel blocker). Others just need a dose change, or sometimes focusing on stress management or further dietary tweaks. Consulting your provider about how stable or elevated your readings have been can help them decide whether intensifying therapy makes sense or if you might respond better to adjusting the current dosage.

It’s crucial to continue monitoring your readings at home to see if there’s a trend. Keep up your exercise routine and balanced diet, and follow up with your healthcare provider for any modifications to your plan.
User: If I want to add a second medication, would it be better to try a diuretic first, or use a calcium channel blocker, or do nothing for now?
