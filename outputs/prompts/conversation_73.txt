User: pls correct me: I want a thorough comparison of dupilumab, omalizumab, and mepolizumab for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, focusing on RCT data about endoscopic polyp size reduction and patient-reported outcomes, especially SNOT-22.

“I want a thorough comparison of dupilumab, omalizumab, and mepolizumab for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, focusing on randomized controlled trial data regarding reductions in endoscopic polyp size and improvements in patient-reported outcomes, especially the SNOT-22 measure.”
User: make easier: I'd also highlight the steroid-sparing benefits across these biologics, given that reduced dependence on steroids is a major goal in management.
Assistant: Here is a simpler version:

“I also want to emphasize that these biologics can help reduce steroid use, which is an important treatment goal.”
User: pls correct me: I'm especially interested in comparing cost and coverage differences. I'd like to mention that some payers might require step therapy before approving these biologics.
Assistant: Here is the corrected version of your text:

“I’m especially interested in comparing cost and coverage differences, noting that some payers might require step therapy before approving these biologics.”
User: pls correct me: I want to note that adverse events, such as injection site reactions or rare systemic issues, may influence patient preference.
Assistant: Here is the corrected version of your text:

“I want to note that adverse events, including injection site reactions or rare systemic issues, may affect patient preference.”
User: pls correct me: I'd like to finalize by stating that the RCT evidence is generally strong for all three biologics, with consistent improvement in nasal symptoms, polyp size, and quality of life, but cost and side effects remain important considerations.
