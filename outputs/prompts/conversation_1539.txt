User: we just pulled a patient out of a burning house and they're not getting enough oxygen
Assistant: smoke inhalation can cause significant airway issues, including swelling and damage to lung tissue. some treatments might include:

1. **intubation**: to secure the airway
2. **medications**: such as steroids or bronchodilators
3. **monitoring**: oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate
4. **ventilator support**: adjusting settings to keep oxygen levels stable

if symptoms worsen or the patient’s vitals drop quickly, more critical measures could be necessary
User: we already intubated them but the airway is swelling severely they're dropping o2 and blood pressure the meds aren't helping
Assistant: severe swelling that’s not improving can be a sign of a rapidly worsening condition. things to consider:

1. **verify tube placement**: ensure the tube is still secure
2. **increase respiratory support**: higher peep or alternate ventilation strategies
3. **specialty help**: ear nose and throat or surgical support may be required
4. **continued medication**: steroids, bronchodilators, and other measures

if the airway is closing or the patient’s vitals keep dropping, it could be life-threatening
User: should we keep trying or do something else
