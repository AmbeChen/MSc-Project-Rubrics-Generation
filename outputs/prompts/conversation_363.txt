User: urgent care note: used inhaler once

= no big issues
Assistant: Using an inhaler once can offer temporary relief if the patient experienced a mild asthma flare. However, there isnâ€™t much detail here about any ongoing symptoms, medications, or follow-up. More context would typically be needed to determine the overall status after the urgent care visit.
