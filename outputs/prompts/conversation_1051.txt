User: I’m putting together a consult note for a new patient with first-time seizures. The EEG shows left temporal epileptiform discharges, and the labs are normal. I’m planning to recommend levetiracetam titration and want to reference guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology. Also need to figure out the right coding for the consult and for follow-up visits. What do you think would be best to include?
