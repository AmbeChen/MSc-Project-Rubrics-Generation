User: can you make code steps for a quick reference for severe hyperkalemia if i see ekg changes, bullet guidelines for immediate therapy with calcium infusion, insulin plus dextrose, then after 15 min recheck potassium and if no improvement do salbutamol diuretics or emergent dialysis and like that
