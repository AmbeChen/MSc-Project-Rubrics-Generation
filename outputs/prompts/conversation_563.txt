User: I had a concussion a few weeks ago, do you think you could help me figure out if it’s safe to drive?
Assistant: I’d be happy to help you think through your situation! Just let me know what your neurologist said, if you had any scans, and any symptoms you’re still feeling, and we can see what might be going on.
User: Okay, so I had a moderate concussion from slipping on ice, and the neurologist said my CT scans were normal, no bleeding or anything. It’s been about a month, and I’m now only having mild headaches that are getting better. The dizziness is gone, and the doc said I can go back to normal activities whenever I feel up to it, so do you think I’m good to start driving now?
