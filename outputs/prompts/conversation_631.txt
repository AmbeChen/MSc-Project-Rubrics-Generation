User: My postpartum patient is 2 weeks after delivering, complains of new shortness of breath and mild pedal edema. Mild tachycardia around 110, denies chest pain. Echocardiogram shows the ejection fraction dropped from 60% to 42%. Labs are normal except for mildly elevated BNP. Vitals stable otherwise. I'd like a concise note summarizing these points.
Assistant: **Nursing Note:**

Patient is 2 weeks postpartum, presenting with new onset shortness of breath and mild pedal edema. Vital signs are stable except for mild tachycardia at 110 bpm. Patient denies chest pain. Echocardiogram reveals a drop in ejection fraction from 60% pre-delivery to 42%. Laboratory results are within normal limits, with a mild elevation in BNP. No other significant abnormalities reported.

Plan to monitor symptoms closely and evaluate for potential postpartum cardiac issues. Continue to assess hemodynamic status and consider further cardiac workup as needed.
User: Now I'd like the top possible causes for her new decreased ejection fraction postpartum based on the note above.
