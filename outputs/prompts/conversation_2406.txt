User: I have a question about my daily routine. I've recently retired, and I'm really concerned about staying active to keep my independence. I don't want to lose my balance or hurt my joints, so I'm trying to find a safe walking routine and maybe some gentle exercises I can do every day. Also, I'm on medication for arthritis, and I wonder if I should adjust my dosage as I get older. Do you have any ideas about how I can handle this?
