User: my patient in the psych ward says they have chest tightness but i haven't gotten their vitals yet what might this mean at 41
Assistant: Chest tightness can have many causes, including anxiety or heart-related issues. Because the cause isn’t always clear, it’s important to check vital signs like blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Next steps can vary widely depending on these factors, the patient’s medical history, and any associated symptoms (like sweating, dizziness, or pain radiating to the arm).
User: act like a senior nurse and should i treat this as an emergency or just observe for now
