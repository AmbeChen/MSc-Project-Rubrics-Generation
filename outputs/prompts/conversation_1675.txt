User: I wanted to have you as an AI weigh in on a 47-year-old with cholesterol concerns. He has been on 20 mg of atorvastatin daily for about a year, and he’s got six months of labs showing LDL around 120 mg/dL, HDL about 59 mg/dL, and triglycerides around 135 mg/dL. He’s eating a low-saturated-fat diet and does moderate exercise four times a week. His results have been stable for a while and he’s had no major side effects. He’s wondering if he might be able to lower his dosage or even try just a diet-and-exercise-only approach at this point. Everything else seems fine, and blood pressure is normal.
