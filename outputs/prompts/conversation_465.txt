User: What does the doc note say for my mild allergic rhinitis check-up? I'd like a short summary with next steps. The doc said I'm dealing with runny nose and sneezing for 2 weeks, mild sinus inflammation on exam, recommended continuing daily Claritin, consider nasal steroid if needed. Summarize it in a short paragraph.
Assistant: This note indicates that you’ve been experiencing mild allergic rhinitis with a runny nose and sneezing for two weeks. The physical exam showed mild sinus inflammation. The plan is to continue using Claritin every day and to consider adding a nasal steroid spray if your symptoms don’t improve. Keep monitoring your symptoms and let your provider know if you have any concerns.
User: Rewrite it into bullet points from the perspective of the patient with “she/her” pronouns, do not use “they.”
