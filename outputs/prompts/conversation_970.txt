User: He’s stable, slight improvement in symptoms, can we do a daily inpatient progress note for the isolation ward?
Assistant: Do we have his vitals, any recent labs, or additional details about his isolation measures? That info helps me include the relevant updates in the progress note.
User: That’s all we know, he’s stable and improving slightly, write the daily note anyway.
