User: Shift started at 7AM, the patient was disoriented and kept asking for the same info repeatedly, no improvement was noted by the time the shift ended at 7PM. The attending physician was not around and there are no further details on vitals or any treatment plan. Hence, evaluate if this inpatient hospital note is complete enough or if anything is missing.
