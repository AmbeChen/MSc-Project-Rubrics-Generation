User: Please re-word this better: A 48-year-old with resistant hypertension on three medications has low potassium and an elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio, raising suspicion of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome). To confirm, tests like the saline infusion test can evaluate whether aldosterone suppresses appropriately. If it remains high, an aldosterone-producing adenoma is likely.
Assistant: A 48-year-old with persistent high blood pressure on triple therapy has hypokalemia and an elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio, suggesting primary hyperaldosteronism (Connâ€™s syndrome). To confirm, tests such as the saline infusion test assess whether aldosterone levels suppress as expected. If they stay high, it often points toward an aldosterone-producing adenoma.
User: Please re-word this better: Imaging such as CT or MRI can help distinguish unilateral adenomas from bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. However, adrenal venous sampling is considered the gold standard to confirm the source of aldosterone. A unilateral lesion can often be removed surgically, while bilateral hyperplasia is typically managed medically with aldosterone antagonists.
Assistant: Imaging methods like CT or MRI can identify whether there is a single adrenal adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. However, adrenal venous sampling remains the definitive test to pinpoint the exact source of aldosterone. If there is a single lesion, surgical removal may be an option; if both glands are involved, medical treatment with aldosterone antagonists is generally used.
User: Please re-word this better: The saline infusion test remains vital for confirming autonomous aldosterone secretion. Persistent high aldosterone levels indicate an adenoma or hyperplasia that isn't suppressing. After imaging, if there's uncertainty about which adrenal gland is involved, adrenal venous sampling is performed. If an adenoma is confirmed on one side, surgical removal is often curative. In bilateral cases, medical therapy is indicated. Could you also clarify whether borderline test results suggest repeating the saline infusion test or considering additional confirmatory measures?
