User: Can you type me out an assessment for a geriatric patient with repeated near-falls at home. Over the past two weeks, his systolic blood pressure has occasionally dropped to around 95, he’s had mild dizziness, and heart rate spikes around 102. He also has stable diabetes. Evaluate if he’s at high risk of a serious injury soon or if conservative management is enough.
