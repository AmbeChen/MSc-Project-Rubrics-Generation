Assistant: Here are some general points about the COVID-19 second booster that might interest you:

### What a Booster Is
1. **Definition**: A booster is an additional vaccine dose that aims to keep up immunity against the virus after protection from the initial shots has waned.
2. **Timing**: Depending on the first series or prior boosters, a second booster is typically given a few months after the previous shot.

### Current Guidelines
3. **Recommendations**: Health authorities in different places update guidelines based on the latest research. Some focus on people with certain risk factors (older age, chronic conditions) while others have broader recommendations.
4. **Eligibility**: Being 35 doesnâ€™t always mean you qualify for a second booster. Some regions limit second boosters to people over a certain age or with particular conditions.

### Potential Side Effects
5. **Common Reactions**: Soreness at the injection site, fatigue, mild fever, and body aches.
6. **Serious Reactions**: Serious side effects are extremely rare but can include allergic responses.

### Additional Notes
7. **Variants**: Newer booster formulas may be adapted to newer variants.
8. **Local Guidance**: Official recommendations can change quickly, so staying updated is important.
9. **More Info**: If you have underlying health issues, check with a health professional who knows your situation.
