User: working on a quick info sheet for my clinic about vitamins and supplements. my patients keep asking if they should do a daily multi. was reviewing the latest USPSTF guidance and want to include that. also want some solid evidence on vit d + calcium for bone health, plus a note about fish oil interactions with anticoagulants. and disclaim that these supplements aren't strictly regulated. i need it short but still detailed enough for a family practice setting.
