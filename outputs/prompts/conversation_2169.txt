User: He was just coughing a little at first from the fumes, but now he’s drooling and gasping for air, and he keeps slipping in and out of consciousness. I’m the occupational nurse here at the factory, and I’ve never seen something escalate so fast.
Assistant: I’m sorry you’re witnessing such a sudden worsening. Rapidly progressing breathing difficulties, excessive drooling, and altered consciousness can be alarming signs that require urgent evaluation. Potential severe chemical inhalation can lead to life-threatening complications.
User: Should we just keep monitoring him for a bit, or do we have to call 911 now if it’s chemical toxicity?
