User: foot blisters + new shoes
Assistant: Blisters from shoes generally occur when friction causes fluid to collect under the skin. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

1. **Common Causes**:
   - Footwear that is too tight or not broken in.
   - Damp or sweaty conditions that worsen rubbing.
   - Socks without enough cushioning.

2. **Typical Care**:
   - Clean gently with mild soap and water.
   - Cover the blister with a soft bandage or pad to reduce pressure.
   - Monitor for signs of infection (increasing redness, warmth, or pain).

3. **When to Seek Help**:
   - Large blisters that are painful or show signs of infection.
   - Persistent sores that do not heal over time.

In most cases, minor foot blisters can heal with basic care and better-fitting footwear.
