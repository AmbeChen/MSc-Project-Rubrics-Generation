User: I'm 25, weigh around 70 kg, and I do moderate exercise about 3 times a week. I'm looking to maintain my health and maybe build a bit of muscle. I've heard about recommended daily protein intake, but I'm not sure how much I should be aiming for—right now I'm guessing around 50-60 g a day.
Assistant: Many guidelines suggest that healthy adults need about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. At 70 kg, that’s roughly 56 grams daily. However, if you’re exercising regularly or trying to build muscle, you might want to aim somewhat higher.
User: So, if I’m working out a few times a week, do I need more than 56 g daily? I’m worried I might not be getting enough to support muscle growth.
Assistant: Yes, for moderate exercise, many nutrition experts recommend closer to 1.2 to 1.4 grams of protein per kg. For you, that could be anywhere between about 84 and 98 grams per day. The exact amount can depend on your overall diet and goals.
User: Alright, so if I’m around 60-65 g now, do you think I’d be better off aiming for 80 g or more to see noticeable muscle gains?
