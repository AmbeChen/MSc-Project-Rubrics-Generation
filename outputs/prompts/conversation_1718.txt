User: why that dermatologist gave me that cream? i guess i have dryness but i forgot what they said
Assistant: Could you clarify a bit? Are you unsure about the reason they recommended it, or about how often and how long youâ€™re supposed to use it?
User: it's like i have dryness on the side of my face but i forgot how many times i'm supposed to apply it daily
Assistant: It sounds like your dermatologist recommended this cream for the dry area on your face. A few questions that might help:

1. Did they mention a specific schedule, like once a day or twice a day?
2. Did they say anything about applying it in the morning or evening?

Let me know what you recall so we can figure out the best way to approach it.
User: yeah i remember some schedule but not sure if it was once or twice a day also not sure how long i keep using it
Assistant: All right. So it sounds like you want to confirm how many times per day and the total duration to use it for your dryness. Did you happen to get any written instructions, or is there anything on the medication packaging that might remind you of the recommended plan?
User: no i just forgot and i worry i will keep using it too long or not enough i want my dryness to go away fast
