User: PortalVeinManagementDoc snippet:

   bridgingMedication = LMWH daily
   bridgingRationale = "Prevents extension of portal vein thrombosis"
   standardProphylaxis = "Compression stockings, early ambulation"

User instruction
Remove bridging references from PortalVeinManagementDoc. This includes references to bridging with LMWH or DOAC. Ensure coverage for new clot formation is handled by other means.
Evaluate the user’s instruction

✅ Good: none of the below options match
⛔️ Ambiguous: there are multiple possible interpretations of how to substitute prophylaxis
ℹ️ The instruction may have partial context around bleeding vs thrombosis risk
⛔️ Lack of context: the doc tries to remove bridging but no alternative prophylaxis is specified
ℹ️ Minor changes for coverage might be needed
⛔️ Non-solvable: the instruction requests removing bridging if there's no replacement method
Assistant: Removing all bridging references for portal vein thrombosis prophylaxis is feasible, but it represents a significant shift in this document’s approach. If we eliminate LMWH or DOAC bridging, we need alternative strategies to prevent clot extension. Would you like guidance on how to adapt the prophylaxis plan to maintain coverage?
User: what will be the solution?
Assistant: The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Delete Bridging Lines**:
   - Remove the lines referring to LMWH daily or DOAC bridging.
   - Remove any references to bridging rationales.

2. **Retain Standard Prophylaxis**:
   - Preserve compression stockings and early ambulation.

3. **Introduce Alternative Safeguards**:
   - Consider utilizing non-bridging prophylaxis measures if clinically indicated (e.g., close imaging follow-up or short courses of prophylactic anticoagulants only if needed).
User: but you removed all prophylaxis so coverage is missing. solution requirements:
1. minimal changes
2. no big rewrite
3. code (doc) should still mention some prophylaxis approach
is correct? (solves user instruction fully?)
✅ yes
⛔️ no
Assistant: ⛔️ no

The approach I gave earlier removed the bridging lines without clearly adding an alternative prophylaxis method. That could leave the patient exposed to thrombosis risk. We should maintain coverage by introducing a small line referencing another prophylaxis strategy. Here’s a more concise modification:

**Minimal Approach**:
- Remove explicit LMWH/DOAC bridging references.
- Add a brief mention of alternative prophylaxis (e.g., short-course anticoagulation in high-risk cases). This ensures minimal changes while preserving the safety net.
User: Can the doc be fixed in a single line or by moving a single code block referencing bridging? Should take under a minute to implement. Is this solution easily fixable?
✅ Yes
⛔️ No
