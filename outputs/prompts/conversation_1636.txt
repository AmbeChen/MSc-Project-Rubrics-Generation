User: In the last month I feel my kidney function is not stable also I'm in Tel Aviv and my doctor mentions there's a local Mediterranean style guideline that's different from the US. I'd want to know if there's really difference in the recommended meal plan and also some typical Israeli meal suggestions that fit the local guidelines?
