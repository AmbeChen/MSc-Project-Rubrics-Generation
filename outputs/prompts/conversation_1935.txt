User: summarize this:
"Data from multiple emergency medicine databases indicates that intramuscular haloperidol typically sedates in about 15-30 minutes, has moderate adverse events, especially extrapyramidal symptoms, but remains widely used. Intramuscular ziprasidone sedation onset is around 10-20 minutes, with some risk of QT prolongation. Intramuscular ketamine acts faster, about 5-10 minutes, but can induce transient psychotomimetic effects. Each agent has distinct safety profiles and sedation times, with no clear consensus on the single best agent for severe acute behavioral disturbances."
Assistant: Intramuscular haloperidol can take 15-30 minutes to achieve sedation and has moderate adverse events, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms. Intramuscular ziprasidone typically takes effect in 10-20 minutes, though it can pose a risk of QT prolongation. Intramuscular ketamine often works within 5-10 minutes but can lead to short-term psychotomimetic effects. There is no unanimous agreement on which agent is best overall for severe acute behavioral disturbances given their respective onset times and safety considerations.
User: summarize and rewrite this:
"An ED director wants a thorough comparison across sedation time, safety, and adverse events for these three agents, gleaned from multiple emergency medicine data sources. The focus is on usage in patients with severe acute behavioral disturbances, with an eye to determining the best sedation approach and reducing harm."
