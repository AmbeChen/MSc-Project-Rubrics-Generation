User: For a 5-year-old with distal RTA type 1, the labs are: serum bicarbonate 15 mmol/L, urine pH 5.8, serum potassium 3.4 mmol/L. I'd like guidance on recommended supplementation (especially for bicarbonate and potassium) and whether you'd check any additional labs for an accurate diagnosis.
Assistant: In a pediatric patient with suspected distal RTA type 1, supplementation typically includes oral bicarbonate or citrate solutions to correct metabolic acidosis, along with potassium if needed for hypokalemia. Monitoring growth parameters and assessing renal function (including eGFR) can be helpful, as well as looking for associated conditions like nephrocalcinosis. Evaluating serum electrolytes, blood pH, and additional markers like urine anion gap or ammonium excretion may clarify the diagnosis and guide therapy. Maintaining a stable serum bicarbonate is crucial to prevent growth retardation and bone demineralization.
User: Child also has mild polyuria and polydipsia = next steps for management?
