User: I sometimes get a weird metallic taste in my mouth after I eat. I'm not on any meds. what could it be
Assistant: Metallic taste can sometimes be triggered by harmless causes like dryness, gum inflammation, or strongly flavored foods. It might also relate to sinus issues, acid reflux, or certain trace minerals in your diet. If itâ€™s persistent or changing in intensity, mentioning it during a routine health check can help determine if something more serious is going on.
User: Is it a deficiency or something. I'm worried it might be a sign of something serious.
