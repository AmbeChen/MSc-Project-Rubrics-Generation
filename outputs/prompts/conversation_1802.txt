User: hey i have a question. i’m a hospice physician recertifying a 79-year-old with advanced lung cancer. the insurance guidelines are so detailed, i get overwhelmed. i want to write a solid note that shows the disease progression and references the official recert criteria, so coverage stays in place. i don’t like feeling so unprepared. can you help me compose a thorough justification?
