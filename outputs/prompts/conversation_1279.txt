User: What does this mean?

I’m a gastroenterologist, I have a patient at West Haven stage 2 hepatic encephalopathy with an ammonia level around 80 µmol/L. I’m adjusting lactulose dosing but wondering if I should start rifaximin prophylaxis now. Are we at the threshold for adding it, or do you usually wait until stage 3 or more advanced?
