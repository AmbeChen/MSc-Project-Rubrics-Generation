User: On a recent consult I saw an adult who’s severely immunocompromised from an organ transplant regimen, presenting with extensive painful oral lesions that appear to be primary herpes simplex stomatitis. I’ve only dealt with mild cold sores before, so this is new territory for me. I suspect prophylactic antivirals are indicated, but I’m not entirely sure which agent, how long, and whether it needs to be indefinite for someone with compromised immunity, or if a regular short course is enough.
