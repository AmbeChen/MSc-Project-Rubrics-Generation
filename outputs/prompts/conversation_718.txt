 prophylactic fluconazole in NICUs to prevent invasive candidiasis
 referencing recent meta-analyses and potential antifungal resistance
Assistant: Prophylactic fluconazole can reduce invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates, especially extremely low birth weight infants. Recent meta-analyses suggest lower fungal infection rates and improved survival. However, concerns include selection of resistant fungal strains, potential alteration in local microbiomes, and stewardship implications. Guidelines vary, but many NICUs employ fluconazole prophylaxis for at-risk populations, balancing benefits of lowered morbidity and mortality with the risk of promoting antifungal resistance. Ongoing surveillance is crucial.
