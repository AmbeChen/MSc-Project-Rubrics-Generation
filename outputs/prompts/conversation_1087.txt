User: immunization schedule for a 2-year old with immunodeficiency??
Assistant: For a 2-year old with immunodeficiency, the typical schedule includes inactivated vaccines like the inactivated influenza shot and pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), among others, adjusted for their medical conditions and risk factors. Live vaccines might require special timing or contraindications depending on the severity of immunosuppression. Consultation with immunization guidelines for high-risk pediatric patients is also recommended.
