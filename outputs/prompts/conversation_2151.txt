User: T81.4 staph infxn after lap chole ??? what does it mean
Assistant: That code T81.4 might be incomplete. It typically indicates a post-surgical infection, but I'd need more context to confirm exactly what you're referring to.
User: I am the surgeon finishing our billing docs for a staph infection following laparoscopic gallbladder removal, can you confirm the correct ICD-10 code
