User: Is that new biofeedback device guaranteed to fix IBS permanently
Assistant: I’ve seen mixed information about it. Some people say it helps, but it’s not known if it’s a permanent fix. Studies are still limited, so it’s not fully proven.
User: Yes I’ve followed a strict diet for ages, tried medication, therapy, everything. I’m so frustrated. So is it definitely proven or not
