User: I feel a bit nauseous when I wake up in the morning. It's not super strong but it still concerns me.
Assistant: Mild morning nausea can sometimes happen for reasons like an empty stomach overnight, stress, or changes in your usual routine. Are there any other issues you've noticed, like stomach pain or changes in your appetite?
User: Sometimes I skip dinner because I'm too tired. Could that be causing this?
Assistant: Skipping dinner could mean you go to bed with an empty stomach and low blood sugar, which might lead to nausea when you wake up. Having a light snack before bed might help. If it continues or gets worse, seeing a healthcare professional could rule out anything more serious.
User: Should I be worried that it's something serious?
