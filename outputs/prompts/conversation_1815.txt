User: Flu symptoms
Assistant: Influenza (commonly called the flu) is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Common symptoms often begin suddenly and can include:

- **Fever or chills**
- **Cough**
- **Sore throat**
- **Runny or stuffy nose**
- **Muscle or body aches**
- **Fatigue**

Some individuals may also experience headaches or gastrointestinal issues. If symptoms worsen or you have difficulty breathing, contact a healthcare professional.
User: Flu complications
Assistant: While many people recover without issues, flu can lead to more serious complications, such as:

- **Pneumonia**
- **Exacerbation of chronic conditions** (e.g., asthma, heart disease)
- **Ear or sinus infections**
- **Severe dehydration**

High-risk groups—such as older adults, young children, and individuals with weakened immune systems—should be monitored closely for signs of worsening illness.
User: Flu triage approach
Assistant: In a clinical setting, triage for possible influenza often includes:

- **Vital sign assessment** (checking temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation)
- **Risk factor evaluation** (e.g., age, comorbidities, immunocompromised status)
- **Symptom duration and severity** (to gauge disease progression)
- **Rapid diagnostic testing** if deemed necessary
- **Decision on level of care** based on presentation, including need for supportive treatment or antiviral therapy

Prompt identification helps prioritize patients at higher risk of complications.
User: Triage doc for nurses
Assistant: For an urgent care setting, a succinct triage documentation guide for flu-like illnesses could include:

1. **Screening Questions**
   - Recent onset of fever, chills, or respiratory symptoms
   - Known exposure to influenza-positive individuals
   - Current flu vaccination status
2. **Thresholds for Immediate Isolation**
   - Severe respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability
   - High-risk conditions requiring urgent evaluation
   - Placement in a separate waiting area or negative-pressure room if available
3. **Follow-up Instructions**
   - Clear discharge guidance on symptom management and warning signs
   - Instructions on seeking further care if deterioration occurs
   - Coordination with primary or specialty care when appropriate
4. **References**
   - Align documentation protocols with **CDC’s seasonal influenza guidelines**
   - Update the document yearly to reflect the latest recommendations
