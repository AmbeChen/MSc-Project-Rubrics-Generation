User: Make sure this is not passive or controlling. I'd like a short, direct algorithm for suspected acute adrenal crisis in a patient on chronic steroids. Mention fluid resuscitation, IV hydrocortisone, labs, and watch for complications...
Assistant: Sure, here's a more direct version:

"For suspected acute adrenal crisis:
1) Start IV fluids with normal saline bolus.
2) Administer IV hydrocortisone promptly.
3) Obtain labs (electrolytes, cortisol, ACTH).
4) Monitor vitals & watch for shock or arrhythmias."
User: Something more stepwise
Assistant: Ok, how about this:

Step 1: Rapid IV fluid bolus with normal saline
Step 2: IV hydrocortisone 100 mg bolus, then continuous infusion or frequent dosing
Step 3: Urgent labs for electrolytes, glucose, cortisol, and ACTH
Step 4: Continuous cardiac monitoring to detect arrhythmias or shock
User: Something else
Assistant: Sure, how about this:

"Suspected acute adrenal crisis:

- Start immediate IV normal saline
- Give 100 mg IV hydrocortisone bolus
- Collect labs (cortisol, ACTH, glucose, electrolytes)
- Monitor vitals, watch for hypoglycemia, shock, and arrhythmias."
User: Make it so I'm suggesting it in an urgent but calm tone
Assistant: How about:

"Let’s initiate rapid IV fluid replacement with normal saline right away. Next, we’ll give IV hydrocortisone at 100 mg. We’ll draw labs for cortisol, ACTH, glucose, and electrolytes. We’ll keep a close eye on vitals, prepared to address shock and arrhythmias promptly."
User: Something. Mention monitoring blood glucose more closely, keep it short.
