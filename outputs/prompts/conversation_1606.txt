User: Could brushing too hard cause my gums to be sore there’s no bleeding or gum disease but they feel irritated
Assistant: Brushing too aggressively can definitely irritate gums, causing mild soreness or tenderness. If it’s just slight discomfort without bleeding or other issues, it often means your gums need a gentler routine. Sometimes switching to a softer toothbrush and using a gentler technique can help them recover.
User: Would warm salt water rinses help
Assistant: Yes, a warm salt water rinse can help soothe minor gum irritation and reduce bacteria around the gumline. It’s usually done by dissolving half a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water and swishing it gently. Just avoid being too vigorous, because that might worsen the irritation.
User: What else can I do to reduce soreness i’d like a quick fix
Assistant: Using a softer-bristle brush, brushing in gentle circles rather than back-and-forth scrubbing, and keeping an eye on your gums over the next few days can help them heal. If you start seeing redness, swelling, or bleeding, it’s good to check in with a dental professional.
User: Do I just keep using a gentler brush or is that not enough
