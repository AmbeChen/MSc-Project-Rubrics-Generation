User: Went to a small Thai pharmacy for prenatal vitamins I'm from Germany not sure if recommended nutrients differ
Assistant: If you’re looking for prenatal vitamins while in Thailand, you might notice different brands and formulations compared to what you were used to in Germany. Some common recommendations for prenatal supplements typically include folic acid, iron, calcium, vitamin D, and iodine. In certain regions, additional vitamins or minerals may be advised depending on local diets or deficiencies.

If you’re unsure about local guidelines, you could ask a healthcare professional in Thailand to confirm whether any specific nutrients are more important here. Generally, picking a prenatal supplement with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid is considered standard, but local recommendations sometimes suggest higher amounts. Make sure your chosen supplement meets your needs for iron and calcium as well, especially if your diet has changed since moving.
