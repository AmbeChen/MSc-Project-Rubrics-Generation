User: my ear is clogged from earwax i have mild discomfort no eardrum perforations or surgeries is it safe to do over the counter ear drops or warm water flushing
Assistant: Using over-the-counter ear drops or gently flushing with warm water can be safe for many people, especially if there’s no history of eardrum perforation or ear surgery. Here’s a quick overview:

- **Over-the-Counter Drops**: These often contain ingredients like carbamide peroxide to soften wax. They’re usually placed in the ear for a few minutes before draining.

- **Warm Water Irrigation**: This technique can help rinse loosened wax from the canal. Typically, you’d use a rubber-bulb syringe or an irrigation kit designed for ear cleaning.

### Caution
1. Stop if you feel pain or dizziness.
2. Avoid forcing water too forcefully into the canal.
3. See a healthcare provider if symptoms persist, or if you notice blood or signs of infection.

If things don’t improve or you experience worsening pain, check with your clinician to rule out any other cause.
