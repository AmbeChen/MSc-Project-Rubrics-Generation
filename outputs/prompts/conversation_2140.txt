User: Why does this newborn of a diabetic mother have borderline low glucose? it's so stressful.
Assistant: Neonates of diabetic mothers can experience low blood glucose due to several factors:

1. **Maternal Hyperglycemia**: High maternal blood sugar leads to excess fetal insulin production, which can continue after birth.
2. **Sudden Change at Birth**: Once the umbilical cord is cut, the glucose supply drops sharply.
3. **Immature Regulatory Mechanisms**: Newborns, especially those with certain risk factors, might struggle to maintain stable glucose levels.
4. **Feeding Challenges**: Delays or difficulties with feeding can further lower their glucose.

Close monitoring, timely feeding, or supplemental glucose can help prevent complications.
User: that last part is kinda messed up! do we feed early or start an IV infusion? are there official guidelines to avoid neuro damage?
