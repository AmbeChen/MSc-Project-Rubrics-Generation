User: What would a doctor do for a rheumatoid arthritis flare? The patient has been experiencing increased morning stiffness lasting about three hours, reports about six swollen joints, and labs from last week show ESR 40 and CRP 15. She is currently on methotrexate 10 mg weekly and low-dose prednisone 5 mg daily. Her rheumatologistâ€™s plan from three months ago was to continue DMARD therapy for at least six months if symptoms remained mild, but consider medication changes if her disease activity turned moderate or severe.
Assistant: For a rheumatoid arthritis flare, a doctor would typically consider several steps depending on disease activity, patient tolerance, and overall clinical status:

### 1. **Assess Disease Activity**
- Evaluate duration of morning stiffness and number of swollen/tender joints.
- Review lab markers of inflammation (e.g., ESR, CRP).
- Compare current findings to prior visits to determine if the disease remains mild, moderate, or severe.

### 2. **Medications**
- **DMARD Adjustment**: If methotrexate monotherapy is insufficient for controlling symptoms, the physician may adjust the methotrexate dose or add another DMARD (such as leflunomide or hydroxychloroquine).
- **Biologic Agents**: In cases of moderate to severe disease that does not respond to conventional DMARDs, biologics (e.g., TNF inhibitors) might be considered.
- **Steroid Taper vs. Increase**: The low-dose prednisone may be temporarily increased during a flare for better control of inflammation.

### 3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**
- The patient would be advised to monitor for changes in symptoms and side effects.
- Regular labs, including liver function tests and inflammatory markers, would be ordered to assess medication safety and effectiveness.

### 4. **Lifestyle and Support**
- Encourage low-impact exercise or physical therapy.
- Stress management and patient education on self-monitoring of symptoms.

Overall, adjustments to therapy would be guided by current disease activity, patient preferences, and lab findings.
User: Organize into categories and paragraphs that would follow a message to the patient about possible medication adjustments. Keep the perspective with "The patient states..." or "She reports..." (keep pronouns as she/her, do not use they).
