User: My baby is 10 months old. I noticed a small pink rash on her left arm this morning, just about the size of a coin, and it doesn’t seem raised or leaking any fluid. She’s acting completely normal, with no fever or fussiness. I’m not sure if I need to do anything. We do have over-the-counter creams and some home remedies like coconut oil or aloe gel. Not sure if we can just apply something at home or if we should visit a pediatrician. Be very detailed on what exactly to do, list all possible creams or home remedies to use, what to avoid, and mention any other steps so it doesn’t get worse.
