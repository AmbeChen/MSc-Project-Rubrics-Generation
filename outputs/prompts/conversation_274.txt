User: what are the main triage steps if someone has an allergic reaction that involves hives or facial swelling
Assistant: Triage for an allergic reaction often focuses on symptom severity and timing. If someone has mild symptoms (localized hives, mild swelling), an oral antihistamine might provide some relief. However, if there is facial swelling or hives that worsen quickly, or if breathing difficulties are noted, immediate medical attention is recommended. Monitoring vital signs—like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation—and assessing for any progression of respiratory distress or other systemic signs helps in determining whether epinephrine administration (e.g., EpiPen) or emergency services are required.

i started having facial swelling, hives, and mild trouble breathing about 45 minutes ago. my heart rate is 112, blood pressure is 135/82, and i feel more anxious by the minute. do i need to use my epipen right now or should i just head to the hospital?
