User: my friend was in a really bad car crash, he's got severe pain on the left side of his stomach, he's super pale and he feels dizzy, like he's gonna pass out
Assistant: This kind of serious pain and dizziness after a car crash can have various causes, including:

### Possible causes
1. **Ruptured or Injured Spleen**
   - Strong impact to the left side of the abdomen can damage the spleen.
2. **Internal Bleeding**
   - Significant trauma can cause bleeding inside the abdominal cavity.
3. **Other Organ Injuries**
   - Kidney or bowel injuries sometimes happen with car accidents.
4. **Rib Fracture or Muscle Injury**
   - Hard impact could break ribs or severely bruise muscles.
5. **Shock**
   - Pale skin, dizziness, and faint feeling can indicate a drop in blood pressure.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Evaluation**
   - Internal injuries can worsen quickly without treatment.
2. **Look for Other Symptoms**
   - Watch for increased abdominal swelling, confusion, or rapid heartbeat.
3. **Limit Movement**
   - Avoid moving him too much.
4. **Monitor Breathing and Pulse**
   - Check for irregular breathing or a fast heart rate.
5. **Seek Urgent Medical Care**
   - If you suspect serious injury, an emergency department visit is critical.
