User: Please help me construct a quick-reference algorithm for suspected anaphylaxis in a 6-year-old with known peanut allergy presenting at the school clinic. Include recommended EpiPen dosage, airway management steps, and guidance for arranging a hospital transfer. Child is showing severe lip swelling and some wheezing again.
