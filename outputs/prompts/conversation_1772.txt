User: i have really bad acne on my cheeks and forehead, and my dermatologist says i might need a strong prescription. but i read it can cause dryness or even mood changes, and now i’m super anxious about it. am i better off just hoping my acne goes away on its own? i don't want to mess up my health.
Assistant: Those concerns are understandable, especially when you read about potential side effects. It might help to speak with your dermatologist about your worries—often, the medication’s benefits outweigh the risks, but it’s best to get a full picture. Severe acne can sometimes leave scars or be more difficult to treat if it’s left alone.

If you’re anxious about dryness, there are ways to manage that, like using gentle cleansers or moisturizers recommended by a medical professional. As for mood changes, that’s something you can monitor together with your doctor or a trusted adult. Not everyone experiences serious side effects, and discussing them openly with your dermatologist can help you make a comfortable decision.
User: im still freaking out though, because i heard that the meds some people take for acne can cause depression. i really hate my face right now, and i keep missing group outings cause im so self-conscious. ive also heard that if i just stop eating oily or sugary stuff, maybe my skin clears up in a week or two. is that realistic?
Assistant: I’m sorry this is causing so much stress—it sounds overwhelming. The link between certain acne medications and depression is still debated, so it’s a good idea to talk about any history of mood issues with your dermatologist. They can guide you on what to watch out for if you start taking a medication.

As for cutting out oily or sugary foods, research on diet and acne is mixed. A balanced diet can help overall health, but it might not fix severe acne on its own, especially not in just a week. Some people do notice changes in their skin after adjusting their diet, but it usually takes more time. Combining a healthy diet with the right treatment your doctor recommends is often the better approach.
User: i just want this acne gone fast, but i’m scared i’ll regret it if i get weird side effects. maybe i should just hide at home until it disappears?
