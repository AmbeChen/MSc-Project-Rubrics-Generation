The patient is an 89-year-old individual with repeated falls of unknown origin, despite a normal head CT and no medication changes. I'm concerned there might be underlying gait disorders, subclinical peripheral neuropathy, or orthostatic hypotension. I'd like a second opinion on the most systematic way to evaluate these possibilities. Let me know if you have any more questions.
