User: i keep getting daily headaches from too much computer time
Assistant: daily headaches from prolonged screen time might be related to eyestrain or muscle tension.
for immediate relief:
1) occasionally rest your eyes
2) ensure proper lighting
3) maintain good posture
4) stay hydrated.
if the headaches persist or worsen, consider a medical evaluation.
