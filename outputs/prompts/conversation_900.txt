Progress Notes
Reed, Samantha, MD - <PRIVATE_DATE>:

8-year-old female with recurrent urinary tract infections (three in the past six months). Most recent episode accompanied by fever of up to 102Â°F. Prior renal and bladder ultrasound performed <PRIVATE_DATE> was normal with no hydronephrosis or structural abnormalities noted.

Physical exam today: Mild suprapubic tenderness, otherwise unremarkable. Vitals stable. Urinalysis shows occasional white blood cells, negative nitrites. Culture pending.

Impression: Recurrent UTIs with persistent febrile episodes.
Plan: Considering imaging to evaluate for renal scarring. Options: triple-phase DMSA scan vs. repeat ultrasound vs. continued observation.

Electronically signed by <PRIVATE_PERSON> at <PRIVATE_DATE> EDT

I want to determine which imaging approach is most appropriate right now for detecting scarring or other issues. Given the prior normal ultrasound, please advise whether a triple-phase DMSA scan or another ultrasound is the best option, or if watchful waiting is adequate.
