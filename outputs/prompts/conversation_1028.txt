User: Are cholera shots recommended when traveling to Thailand
Assistant: They can be recommended under certain circumstances, especially if you’ll be visiting areas with poor sanitation or limited access to safe water. The cholera vaccine is generally advised for travelers whose itineraries might place them at higher risk.

Typical points to consider:

1. **Travel itinerary**: Remote or rural locations may have different risks.
2. **Length of stay**: Longer stays can increase potential exposures.
3. **Food and water hygiene**: Even with strict precautions, some people opt for vaccination as an extra layer of protection.

If you’re uncertain, a travel clinic or official guidelines can provide personalized recommendations.
User: What about polio boosters for trips to Thailand
Assistant: If you’ve completed a standard polio vaccination series in childhood, many people remain protected for life, but some travelers choose a one-time booster for additional safety if they’re going to certain regions. Polio is rare, yet official travel recommendations sometimes advise a booster if your vaccinations are outdated.

Key considerations:

1. **Last polio vaccination**: Adults who haven’t had a booster since childhood may benefit from an update.
2. **Regional guidelines**: Some countries or travel advisories encourage a polio booster depending on local transmission status.
3. **Overall immunization status**: Keeping all adult vaccinations current is typically recommended.
