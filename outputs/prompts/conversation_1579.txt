User: c/o hyperesthesia in extremities, no hx of trauma or recent infection. possible causes?
Assistant: Hyperesthesia in the extremities can result from various conditions. Potential causes include peripheral neuropathies, vitamin deficiencies like B12 deficiency, thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, or exposure to certain medications or toxins. Any additional symptoms or relevant medical history?
User: also reports fatigue and muscle weakness, thyroid levels normal
Assistant: The combination of hyperesthesia, fatigue, and muscle weakness could point toward vitamin B12 deficiency, electrolyte imbalances, or neurological conditions. Considering thyroid levels are normal, has there been any issues with nutrient absorption, dietary changes, or medications that might affect vitamin levels?
User: no GI issues, diet seems usual. pt is on metformin for t2dm, glucose controlled
Assistant: Long-term use of metformin is associated with decreased absorption of vitamin B12, which can lead to deficiency and neuropathic symptoms. It would be advisable to check the patient's B12 levels. If deficient, supplementation and periodic monitoring may be necessary.
User: got it, what's the recommended dosage for B12 supplementation in this scenario?
