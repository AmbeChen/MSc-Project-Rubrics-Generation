User: Symptoms of diabetic foot ulcers
Assistant: Diabetic foot ulcers are open sores or wounds that typically form on the bottom of the foot in people with diabetes. Common signs include:

1. **Persistent skin breakdown** or ulcers that don’t heal promptly
2. **Redness** and swelling around the area
3. **Drainage** or fluid from the lesion
4. **Callused or thickened skin** around pressure points
5. **Numbness** or reduced sensation due to neuropathy
6. **Discoloration** or foul odor in more advanced cases

If you suspect a diabetic foot ulcer, it’s important to address it early with proper care and follow-up.
User: I have a few patients presenting with thick calluses, numbness, and a little drainage. They also report some pain around the affected areas, and I’m thinking it might be foot ulcers.
Assistant: Thick calluses, numbness, and drainage can suggest a developing or active ulcer, especially in diabetic patients who may have reduced sensation in their feet. Early intervention is key to preventing infection and promoting healing. Thorough debridement, offloading measures, and proper wound care are commonly advised. It’s essential to watch for:

1. **Signs of infection**, such as redness, warmth, or foul odor
2. **Progression of ulcer depth**, which can lead to complications
3. **Poor circulation**, indicated by slow healing or discoloration

Close monitoring and collaboration with a multidisciplinary team—potentially including podiatrists, endocrinologists, and wound care specialists—can improve outcomes for these patients.
User: In my clinic, I want a standardized foot exam checklist referencing the American Diabetes Association guidelines. Also need to know how to incorporate those exams into our workflow.
