User: help with email: quick question. iâ€™d like references from major prospective cohort studies that focus on biomarkers and imaging findings predicting progression from undifferentiated arthritis or ACPA-positive states to full RA. also a brief mention of how EULAR guidelines address early intervention in high-risk individuals, so i can send to dr. patterson.
