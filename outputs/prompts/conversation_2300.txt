User: I have a 52-year-old patient with extensively drug-resistant TB in the left lung. I'm considering combining bedaquiline, pretomanid, and delamanid, but only small pilot studies are out there. The patientâ€™s situation is well-characterized, but I'm worried about synergy and possible severe side effects. Are there any established recommendations or protocols to minimize risk with this combination?
