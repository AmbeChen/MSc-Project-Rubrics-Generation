User: Acute cellular rejection: infiltration by T-lymphocytes damaging myocytes. paraphrase it in one sentence
Assistant: Acute cellular rejection involves T-lymphocytes infiltrating and harming the transplanted myocardial cells.
User: Antibody-mediated rejection: associated with donor-specific antibodies and complement activation. paraphrase it in one sentence
Assistant: Antibody-mediated rejection is driven by donor-specific antibodies that activate the complement system.
User: C4d immunofluorescence is a key marker for identifying antibody-mediated rejection. paraphrase it in one sentence
Assistant: C4d staining via immunofluorescence is crucial for diagnosing antibody-mediated rejection.
User: Assess histological features, including interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates and myocardial damage, to confirm acute cellular rejection. paraphrase it in one sentence
Assistant: Confirming acute cellular rejection relies on identifying lymphocytic infiltration and evidence of injury to cardiac myocytes.
User: Develop a structured approach to distinguish acute cellular from antibody-mediated rejection, incorporating C4d testing. paraphrase it in one sentence
