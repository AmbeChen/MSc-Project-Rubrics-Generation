User: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)

Symptoms:

1. Urinary frequency, including 2-3 nighttime visits (nocturia)
2. Some difficulty starting urine flow

Current medication:

Tamsulosin (an alpha-blocker) for the last few weeks, moderate improvement

Lifestyle changes recommended:

1. Reduce caffeine intake
2. Limit fluid intake in the evening
3. Regular follow-up checkups every 6-12 months

Explain in easy language
Assistant: BPH is a benign enlargement of the prostate gland that can make it harder to pass urine. Tamsulosin helps relax the muscle in the prostate to improve urine flow. Reducing caffeine and cutting back on evening liquids can lessen symptoms, while regular checkups help track progress and catch complications early.
User: Additional note:

Reported mild dizziness and occasional headache since starting Tamsulosin.

Please draft a patient education handout covering what BPH is, typical symptoms, how alpha-blockers help, lifestyle tips, and recommended follow-up intervals. Make it patient-friendly.
