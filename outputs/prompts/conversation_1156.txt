User: what sedation is typically used for a minor endoscopy day procedure?
Assistant: For a minor endoscopy in a day procedure setting, doctors often employ moderate (conscious) sedation. Common medications include:

- **Midazolam (Versed)**: A short-acting benzodiazepine for relaxation and mild amnesia.
- **Fentanyl** or another opioid: For pain control.
- A combination of these medications can be used, monitored by anesthesia or nursing staff trained in sedation.

Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation) are closely monitored, and patients generally recover quickly, with discharge instructions on activity level and follow-up.
User: Summarize the entire day procedure for Ms. T, date 3/10, she had a minor endoscopy, keep pronouns as she/her and do not use they. Include sedation used, complications, next steps, staff instructions. This is all the info i have.
