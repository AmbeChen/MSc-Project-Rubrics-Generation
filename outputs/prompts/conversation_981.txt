User: preoperative consult note? 64-year-old with mild COPD
stable spirometry from last 6 months (FEV1 ~85% predicted)
no recent exacerbations
normal spO2 at 98% on room air
he hasn't used antibiotics or steroids lately
he walks around the house without dyspnea
any hidden respiratory problems we should consider?
should we get chest x-ray or arterial blood gas or do we skip further tests?
how do we confirm he's safe for anesthesia?
