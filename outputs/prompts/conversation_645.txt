User: How to soothe a colicky newborn?
Assistant: ***The confidence level in this response is high.***  

Common strategies to help soothe a colicky newborn often involve gentle comfort measures and thoughtful observation:

1. **Rocking or Swaddling**  
   - Movement and secure wrapping can help calm an overstimulated infant.  
2. **Reducing Stimulation**  
   - Dim lights and lower noise levels to create a more soothing environment.  
3. **Pacifier or Nursing**  
   - Sucking can be calming for some babies.  
4. **Burping**  
   - Trapped gas sometimes contributes to fussiness. Burp the baby gently after feeding.
User: whats the typical daily duration of colic episodes?
Assistant: ***The confidence level in this response is high.***  

Colic episodes often follow the “rule of three”:  
- They generally start by around **3 weeks** of age.  
- Infants may cry for **3 or more hours** a day.  
- Episodes can occur **3 or more days** per week and last for about **3 weeks** or longer.  

The length of crying spells can vary, but many colicky infants experience their most intense episodes during late afternoon or evening hours.
User: whats the difference between colic and normal fussiness?
Assistant: ***The confidence level in this response is high.***  

Babies normally fuss to communicate needs like hunger, discomfort, or tiredness. In colic:

- **Intensity:** Crying is louder, more urgent-sounding, and harder to soothe.
- **Timing:** It often occurs in predictable daily spells, usually late in the day.
- **Duration:** Episodes may persist well beyond the typical short fussiness of a hungry or tired infant.

If an otherwise healthy baby has long periods of intense crying without a clear cause, it’s more likely to be colic.
