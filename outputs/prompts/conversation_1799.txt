User: mammography guidelines for average risk women
Assistant: **Mammography** is an imaging technique used to screen for breast cancer. It can help detect tumors at early stages, potentially improving treatment outcomes.

### General Information
- For average-risk women (those without a significant family history or genetic predisposition), screening mammography is typically recommended on a regular schedule.
- Different organizations (like the USPSTF, ACS, and ACR) have slightly varying recommendations regarding when to start and how frequently to screen.
- The decision often considers factors such as age, individual risk profile, and patient preference.

### Key Considerations
- Potential benefits include earlier detection and improved chances of successful treatment.
- Potential harms include false positives, unnecessary biopsies, and anxiety.
- Many guidelines emphasize shared decision-making, especially for women under 50.

If you have questions about scheduling or deciding on the right time to start mammograms, it may help to consult a healthcare professional who can personalize the recommendation based on your overall health and preferences.
