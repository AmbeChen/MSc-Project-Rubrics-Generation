Hello,
I saw a 65-year-old patient with left arm spasticity following a stroke one year ago. He's been attending physical therapy sessions three times a week. We tried baclofen, but it caused significant sedation, so it was discontinued. Then we tried tizanidine, which provided only mild improvement.
He also has mild hypertension.
He wants to find better relief for his spastic arm.
What is the best approach to reduce his spasticity further?
