User: Which vaccines do i need if traveling abroad
Assistant: I can help you figure that out. Let’s go over your travel details. Typically, travel vaccine recommendations depend on your destination(s), how long you’ll be there, any prior immunizations you have, and your overall health. Knowing these specifics is really important to give you accurate guidance.
User: I haven't decided which country or how long I'll stay. I also can't remember which shots I already have, so I'd like to know if I'm covered or not
