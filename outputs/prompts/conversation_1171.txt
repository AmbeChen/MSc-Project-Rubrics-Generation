User: what is the normal rbc range
Assistant: Normal red blood cell (RBC) counts can vary slightly depending on the lab and the patient’s sex. Here are typical ranges:

- **Adult Males:** Approximately 4.7–6.1 million cells/µL
- **Adult Females:** Approximately 4.2–5.4 million cells/µL

These values may vary based on the laboratory’s reference range, altitude, and the individual’s overall health. If someone’s RBC falls outside these parameters, further evaluation may be necessary.
User: what are rbc indices about
Assistant: Red blood cell indices are additional measurements that give more detail about the RBCs in someone’s bloodstream. They typically include:

- **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** Indicates the average size of RBCs.
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH):** Shows the average amount of hemoglobin per RBC.
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC):** Reflects the concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of RBCs.
- **Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** Measures the variation in RBC size.

These indices help clinicians identify certain types of anemia or other blood disorders by showing whether the RBCs are too large or too small, or if there’s a wide variation in size.
User: thanks rbc is normal for our patient but the rest like rbc indices wbc and platelets aren’t in yet can you rephrase this mychart note: “we have reviewed your labs thoroughly all results are normal no further action required” i want the patient to see it even though not all tests came back
