User: my tailbone has been sore ever since i switched from a standing station to a seated desk job
Assistant: Tailbone discomfort can sometimes arise when people transition to prolonged sitting, especially if posture or seating arrangements change. A few factors may contribute:

1. **Postural Changes**:
   - Sitting for long periods with poor lower-back support or slouching can place pressure on the coccyx.

2. **Lack of Cushioning**:
   - Hard or poorly padded chairs can concentrate force on the tailbone.

3. **Reduced Movement**:
   - Sitting continuously may limit blood flow and cause stiffness in the lower back or pelvis.

4. **Pre-Existing Irritation**:
   - If the coccyx was previously irritated or bruised, more sitting might worsen that soreness.

5. **Pinched Nerve or Disc Issues**:
   - While less common, spinal or nerve compression could manifest as tailbone-area pain.

Observing when the pain flares (e.g. after how many hours of sitting) or easing (e.g. standing, lying down) can help clarify its nature.
User: are there typical signs to look for that might show it's not just bad posture?
Assistant: Common signs that suggest something beyond posture might include:

1. **Persistent or Intensifying Pain**:
   - Pain that worsens even if you adjust your sitting position or use cushions.

2. **Swelling or Bruising**:
   - Noticeable swelling or a bruise near the tailbone area can indicate an injury rather than just posture.

3. **Pain with Minimal Pressure**:
   - Discomfort that flares with slight touch or gentle pressure on the lower spine.

4. **Pain Radiating to Legs**:
   - Sharp or shooting sensations down the legs or buttocks, which could signal nerve involvement.

5. **Constant Ache**:
   - Continuing soreness even when youâ€™re not seated might point to an underlying issue besides posture.

However, posture can still be a major factor, so looking closely at how you sit and what you sit on is important to rule out simpler causes before considering more complex ones.
User: i sometimes feel a pins-and-needles sensation in my right leg, is that a sign of a pinched nerve or could it still be coccydynia from posture?
