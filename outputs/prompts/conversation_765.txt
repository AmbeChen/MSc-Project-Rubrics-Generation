User: got a big blister on my foot from new shoes. should i pop it or what?
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a blister. It's generally best not to pop it, as the skin protects against infection. You can cover it with a clean bandage or blister pad to help protect it while it heals. If it's painful, cushioning it might make walking more comfortable.
User: it's making it hard to walk though. is there any safe way to deal with it?
Assistant: If the blister is causing a lot of discomfort, you can try using a donut-shaped pad to relieve pressure. Cut a hole in a piece of moleskin or padding and place it around the blister. This can help reduce friction when you walk. Be sure to keep the area clean and dry. If the blister bursts on its own, gently clean it with mild soap and water, apply an antibiotic ointment, and cover it with a sterile bandage.
User: can't really see a doctor right now. is there anything else i can do at home?
