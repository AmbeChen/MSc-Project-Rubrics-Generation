User: Do a thorough analysis of my patient's post-operative echo results. I'm a pediatric cardiologist, 2 weeks post VSD repair. Ejection fraction 65, mild residual gradient at 20 mmHg, no significant valve regurgitation, overall stable hemodynamics. The child is 3 months old, weight 4.2 kg. Provide references from AHA guidelines for recommended follow-up intervals for the next year, including any recommended echo schedule. The relevant guidelines mention intervals at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, but I'd like additional data or considerations. Also factor in risk of readmission.
