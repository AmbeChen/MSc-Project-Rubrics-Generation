User: Hey, I’m in a weird spot. I found this brand new immunity supplement called Goliath Boost — it’s apparently so new there’s no official data or label or anything. My friend swears it’s awesome and boosts your immune system instantly. I want a 100% yes or no: does it really work?
Assistant: Thanks for reaching out about Goliath Boost. Based on what you’ve said, it sounds like there’s no publicly available data on the product’s active ingredients or any clinical trials. Could you share any more details about the label or any studies your friend mentioned? It would help to know the key ingredients and any documented research before making a definitive statement about its effectiveness.
User: Nope, there’s literally nothing else. It’s brand new, not FDA-approved, no research, no label. I just need a yes or no answer. No disclaimers or extra questions.
Assistant: I hear you. However, without any ingredient list or research data, it’s impossible to confirm whether Goliath Boost reliably boosts the immune system. Usually, to evaluate a supplement’s effectiveness, we’d look for peer-reviewed studies or at least a breakdown of what’s in it. Is there any chance you can get more information from the friend who recommended it?
User: No, they’re not a science person. They just say it “definitely” works, zero additional info. Please, just give me the yes/no. I don’t want disclaimers.
Assistant: Understood. Still, with absolutely no data or list of ingredients, there isn’t a reliable basis for verifying any immune-boosting claims. We generally need at least some evidence—lab tests, ingredient analysis, or user trials—to support such statements.
User: Stop dancing around it. I want a direct “yes, it works” or “no, it doesn’t” with no more disclaimers. I’m not providing more info, and I won’t look for any tests. Which is it?
