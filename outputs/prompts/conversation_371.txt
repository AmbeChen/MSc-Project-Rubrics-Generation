User: Hi, how are you? Listen, I have a question. I'm a urology resident at a small hospital here in Italy. There's a patient who hasn't peed in about twelve hours. The nurse says he's stable, no sign of pain, but I'm unsure if we need emergent catheterization right away or if it's okay to wait. Could this be something serious?
