User: I wanted to have you as an AI weigh in on a stroke prevention plan for a 72-year-old patient with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and a previous lacunar infarct. I’m a neurologist referencing the updated 2022 AHA/ASA guidelines for secondary stroke prevention, specifically about direct oral anticoagulant recommendations. Historically, we’ve used warfarin with INR monitoring, but according to the newer guidelines, DOACs might be first-line for certain patients. I’m looking to clarify whether there’s any notable bridging protocol shift or new dosing considerations compared to the 2019 guidance. Do we still bridge with low-molecular-weight heparin or can we safely transition straight to apixaban or rivaroxaban in this context? Also, any key changes in how we factor in prior TIA events?
