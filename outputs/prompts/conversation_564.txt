User: Is this plan appropriate for a quick emergent evaluation of a sudden, severe headache? Order a noncontrast CT scan immediately, and if it's negative but suspicion for subarachnoid hemorrhage remains high, proceed with a lumbar puncture. If the CT or LP shows blood, consult neurosurgery. I'd like a concise flowchart with these steps.
