User: rewrite this prophylaxis note for Dr. Rowan to use and highlight the recommended dose adjustment for stage 3 ckd: typical prophylaxis regimen is 2g of cefazolin IV prior to colonoscopy. in moderate renal impairment, reduce to 1g total dose to prevent accumulation. confirm no hepatic impairment and proceed with the lower dose.

weâ€™re thrilled to share that this approach is consistent with the latest guidelines and ensures optimal patient safety!
