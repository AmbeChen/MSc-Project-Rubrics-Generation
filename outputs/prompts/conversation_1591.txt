Assistant: Subject: Confirming Evolocumab Dosing in Advanced CKD

Hi Team,

I hope you're doing well.

I'm reaching out regarding a patient with advanced CKD who continues to have elevated LDL levels despite ongoing therapy. I'd like to confirm whether we should modify the dosing or frequency of evolocumab in this scenario.

Could you please advise if there are any recommended adjustments or considerations for administering evolocumab in advanced renal impairment? Additionally, if there are any alternative approaches you suggest, let me know.

Thanks for your guidance.

Best regards,

Hi [Pharmacy Contact],

I hope all is well.

I’m writing to verify whether our patient's insurance plan will cover any modifications to the evolocumab regimen, including changes to the dose or dosing frequency. The patient has advanced CKD, and we’re discussing potential adjustments with the advanced lipid clinic.

Could you please confirm the coverage details for these possible changes? Let me know if you require any additional information.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
