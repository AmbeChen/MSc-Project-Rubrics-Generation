User: I gave birth about a month ago and was diagnosed with postpartum depression. My doctor put me on a low dose of citalopram (10 mg) and I’m also doing weekly therapy sessions. I’m breastfeeding, have no allergies, and I’m not having any suicidal thoughts. I feel so exhausted I can hardly do the basic stuff at home, and it’s been going on for weeks. Do you think it’s normal, or should I discuss adjusting my medication with my doctor?
