User: shorter - 14-year-old with persistent headaches, found to have a large ependymoma in the fourth ventricle. considering a vermis-splitting vs telovelar approach to expose and resect the tumor, including the floor of the ventricle if possible. also weighing recommended adjuvant radiotherapy if complete resection isnâ€™t achievable
