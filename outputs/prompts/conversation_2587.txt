User: is it normal that my jaw has been clicking every time i chew for like the last few months and it sometimes hurts and i feel like maybe i have tmj or something but i havent even had a dentist check it so i dont know if i should be worried or if it can go away on its own i guess i just dont wanna have major jaw problems
