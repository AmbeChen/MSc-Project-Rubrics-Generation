User: The patient is a 62-year-old with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes for nearly two decades. There's a chronic left foot ulcer that hasn't responded to specialized wound dressings, offloading, and antibiotics for the past three months. Imaging with MRI revealed early osteomyelitis changes. Risk of infection progression and possible amputation remains high. We want to proceed with 30 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve healing and avoid surgical intervention. Provide the prior authorization statement including the patientâ€™s diagnosis, the conservative management already attempted, and justification for insurance coverage.
