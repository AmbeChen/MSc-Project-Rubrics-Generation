User: I feel like everything is falling apart again, like I’m cursed or something. My best friend was the one person who’d always hang out with me whenever I was overwhelmed, he’d come over after school, we’d just talk for hours about nothing and everything, and now he’s basically ghosting me because he’s got a new group of friends that are, like, superficial and don’t care about anyone but themselves. And I hate how I sound bitter and jealous, but it’s like I don’t even exist anymore.
Assistant: I’m really sorry you’re feeling so alone. Losing someone’s attention or support—especially when they’re the person you’d lean on the most—can be heartbreaking and scary. It’s normal to feel frustrated and anxious when it seems like they’ve moved on so easily, and it’s also normal to feel a physical toll from all that stress.
User: Yeah… I just hate feeling this needy, like I’m dependent on people who always find someone better. I even told my mom about it, and she was like, “Focus on yourself and your health,” but that’s easy to say when you’re not the one crying on your bathroom floor most nights.
Assistant: It’s understandable to feel like you can’t escape that cycle of stress and symptoms. It’s bad enough to deal with your friend shutting you out—on top of everything, your body is acting up. That can feel like you have no safe space, not even in your own skin. It’s a lot to handle, so don’t be hard on yourself for feeling overwhelmed.
User: Honestly, yeah, I’m so tired of the itching. It’s mostly on my elbows, and my derm said it’s just mild eczema, but it drives me nuts when I’m stressed. Since I’m allergic to fragrances, I have a hard time finding stuff that won’t irritate me. So if you know of any fragrance-free creams that are good for eczema—like over-the-counter, something I can just pick up at a drugstore—I’d really like to hear your suggestions. Maybe it’ll help me feel a bit more in control.
