User: Write it correct On <PRIVATE_DATE>, father brought his child to the clinic complaining of occasional burning sensation in the stomach area, no prior testing or labs done, no known past medical history. On <PRIVATE_DATE>, father reported that the burning sensation continued at night, child has not tried any medication before. On <PRIVATE_DATE>, father refused endoscopy or further work-up, but insisted on receiving a prescription. On <PRIVATE_DATE>, father specifically asked if we could give 'GastroHeal' to the child to stop this burning sensation right away. Is 'GastroHeal' safe here, or is it contraindicated?
