3. **Age**: Risk can increase as people get older.
4. **Other Conditions**: Such as kidney disease or hormonal disorders.

### **Symptoms**:
Hypertension is often called the “silent killer” because it may not show symptoms until complications develop. Some individuals might experience headaches, dizziness, or blurred vision.

### **Diagnosis**:
- **Blood Pressure Measurement**: Typically measured on multiple occasions.
- **Additional Tests**: Blood tests, urine tests, or ECG to check for complications.

### **Management**:
1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Reducing salt intake, regular exercise, weight management.
2. **Medication**: Commonly prescribed drugs include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or beta-blockers.
3. **Monitoring**: Routine blood pressure checks are crucial.

User: So for the past two weeks I've had this dull ache in my back molar. It's manageable but I definitely notice it when I chew. My next dentist appointment isn't for another three weeks—do I need to see someone sooner or is it okay to wait?
