User: Write a comedic "GI diagnostic jam" about investigating a weird parasite in a patient with watery diarrhea, mention standard stool tests in Verse 1, and highlight advanced serologies or molecular assays in the Chorus
Assistant: Verse 1:
Wakin’ up to trouble, that patient’s in distress,
Watery waves of chaos, gotta find the cause, no less.
Grab that stool O&P, scope out all the clues,
Searching for odd parasites in those funky test tubes.

Pre-Chorus:
We’re sifting through the details, colons in a swirl,
We need real solutions in this GI underworld.

Chorus:
We got advanced serologies and molecular assays in sight,
When the usual suspects hide, these tests bring them to light.
We’re jammin’ for the patient, chasing the truth on the run,
In this comedic GI saga, let’s nail that bug, then we’re done!
User: Make it simpler and catchier, but still complete with recommended next steps in diagnosing a parasite
Assistant: Verse 1:
Patient’s running to the restroom, bowels in a twist,
Stool O&P’s the first move that we can’t resist.

Pre-Chorus:
We’ll check for eggs and bugs, see what might appear,
This watery fiasco needs answers, that’s clear.

Chorus:
If routine tests fall short, and the cause is still unknown,
Advanced serologies, molecular magic—let them be shown.
We’re after that sneaky parasite, we won’t let it hide,
Follow these steps, and your diagnosis takes pride.
User: Add "PCR-based GI panel for you" in the chorus, highlight that it’s recommended if O&P is inconclusive
Assistant: Verse 1:
Patient on the run, watery trouble so real,
Stool O&P’s our opener, that’s the first reveal.

Pre-Chorus:
We look for protozoa, for worms and their eggs,
If nothing shows, we gotta switch our legs.

Chorus:
If O&P is inconclusive, we’ve got a clue:
“PCR-based GI panel for you” to see what’s true.
Advanced tests uncover secrets lurking in the dark,
We’ll chase that parasite ‘til we’ve hit our mark.
User: Mention serologic tests for microsporidia in Verse 2
