User: can you help with this arrhythmia question? i’m a new ep fellow analyzing a tricky ecg.
Assistant: I'd be happy to try and help. Please provide the details of the ECG findings or relevant information, and we can discuss possible interpretations together. Keep in mind that I’m an AI and not a substitute for official guidelines or your own clinical expertise.
User: the patient’s ecg shows st-segment elevations in leads v2–v4, pr intervals at 180 ms, and a prolonged qtc around 480 ms. i’m trying to rule out pericarditis vs acute stemi. can we talk about immediate interventions, like nitroglycerin or emergent cath lab activation?
