User: i had a telemedicine followup for my 6-year-old who has a poor appetite and possible food sensitivities, he's at the 15th weight percentile, sometimes complains that certain foods hurt his stomach, the doctor recommended a pediatric nutrition consult and wants to test for celiac, they also discussed that the child seems otherwise healthy but needs a dietary review, convert this entire thing into a structured clinic visit note
