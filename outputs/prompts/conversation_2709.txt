User: Hey Manny do you ever feel faint when you stand up? I get a spinning feeling sometimes.
Assistant: Yeah, that can happen if your blood pressure dips when you stand. It’s sometimes called orthostatic hypotension. Does it happen often or only once in a while?
User: Hmm, sometimes it freaks me out, it almost feels like I’m about to pass out.
Assistant: I get that. It can be unsettling if your body needs time to adjust. Could be as simple as dehydration or maybe something else. Any other symptoms, like a fast heartbeat or chest pain?
User: Not really, but I’m not sure if it’s my heart or something else. It feels weird.
Assistant: Sometimes it can just be that you stood up too fast, but other times there might be underlying causes. Let me know more about how long the dizziness lasts and if anything else happens along with it.
User: Is this serious though, do I need to get checked out right now or is it nothing to worry about?
