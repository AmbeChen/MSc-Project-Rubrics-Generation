User: in pediatric anaphylaxis, i have a 6-year-old who might need epinephrine, i'd like an evidence-based overview on dosing guidelines and observation period. however, i also need to confirm recommended discharge criteria, so that i can ensure safe management, but not keep the child unnecessarily.
