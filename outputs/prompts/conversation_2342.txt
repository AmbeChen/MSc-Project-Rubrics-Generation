User: We've had a surge of strep throat at our pediatric urgent care, could you outline recommended antibiotic regimens?
Assistant: Yes, strep throat is typically caused by Group A Streptococcus (GAS). Here are some common antibiotic options:

1. **Penicillin V** or **Amoxicillin**: Often first-line, dosed according to weight, for about 10 days.
2. **Intramuscular Benzathine Penicillin G**: A single-dose injection that can help with compliance.

Confirm the diagnosis with a rapid strep test or culture. In a clinic setting, it’s important to ensure proper documentation and follow-up.
User: If a patient is allergic to penicillin, what alternative do you recommend? We also want to keep our patient flow efficient.
Assistant: For patients with penicillin allergies, typical alternatives include:

- **Cephalosporins (e.g., Cephalexin)**: For non-severe allergies, usually given for 10 days.
- **Macrolides (e.g., Azithromycin, Clarithromycin)**: Appropriate for more severe allergies; Azithromycin may be 5 days.

Be sure to confirm the type of allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis vs. mild rash) when selecting an alternative.
User: We’d like to switch to a once-daily regimen for better compliance in our practice. Could you detail recommended options and dosages for different pediatric age groups?
