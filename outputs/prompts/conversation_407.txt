User: The patient is in her second trimester, complaining that she noticed mild vaginal bleeding about two hours ago. She reports no large clots, denies severe pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath. Her blood pressure is 110/70, heart rate 85. She is worried and asking whether she should go to the hospital right away for an OB check, or if she can safely follow up outpatient. No other concerns noted on examination, which is otherwise unremarkable.
