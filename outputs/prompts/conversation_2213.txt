User: My younger brother is in his 20s with mild swelling around a partially erupted wisdom tooth. It's a bit sore but he can still chew normally. He's thinking of waiting a few days to see a dentist if it doesn't get better on its own. There's no major pain or other problems. What might happen? What can he do?
