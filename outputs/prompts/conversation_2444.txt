User: Reword this in a professional paragraph to present to the patient. I had the pleasure of speaking with Jane White on April 2nd. She asked: “What did my colonoscopy show, and when is the next one?” I do not have the GI procedure notes or follow-up recommendations. I want to ensure she has no confusion about her results or scheduling, but I'm missing her official report from the GI’s office. I will check back with her soon to clarify any details she may need.
