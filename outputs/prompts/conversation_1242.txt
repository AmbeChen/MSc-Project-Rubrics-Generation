User: Hi Dr. Jacobs,

I have a 2-year-old patient whose weight is below the 5th percentile for age. I'm unsure whether we should order screening labs (like hemoglobin or metabolic tests) or arrange a dietitian consult next. Let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards,

**Subject:** Next Steps for 2-Year-Old Patient with Low Weight

Hi Dr. Jacobs,

I’m evaluating a 2-year-old whose weight is below the 5th percentile. I’m wondering if we should begin by ordering screening labs—such as hemoglobin and basic metabolic tests—or if scheduling a consultation with a dietitian is the priority. Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards,
Rachel

I added a clear subject line and some detail on which labs you’re considering. Let me know if this helps!
User: Thanks for that version! One more detail: the child's social environment might be unstable, and I'm worried about poor dietary intake. Could you include that in the note?

Best,
Rachel
Assistant: Absolutely! Here’s a revised version that highlights the social concern:

Hi Dr. Jacobs,

I’m evaluating a 2-year-old whose weight is below the 5th percentile. The child may have an unstable social environment, and I’m concerned about inadequate dietary intake. Should we start with screening labs—like hemoglobin and basic metabolic tests—or arrange a dietitian consult first? 

Please share your thoughts.

Kind regards,

I included the social context you mentioned. Let me know if this captures everything!
User: Looks good, thanks! Also, I'd like to confirm the next step. Should we do basic lab screenings or get a dietitian to assess first?

Hi Dr. Jacobs,

I’m evaluating a 2-year-old whose weight is below the 5th percentile. The child’s social environment may be unstable, and I’m concerned about inadequate dietary intake. Would you recommend we start with screening labs (e.g., hemoglobin, metabolic panel) or proceed with a dietitian consult first?

Kind regards,

I highlighted the immediate question about labs versus dietitian consult. Let me know if you need any further revisions!
User: Before I finalize and send this to Dr. Jacobs, I'd appreciate your direct suggestion: do you think we should proceed with screening labs now, or should the dietitian consultation be the priority? Or maybe both at once?

Thanks,
Rachel
