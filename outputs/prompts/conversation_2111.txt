User: please check whether a follow-up cardiac MRI is appropriate
Assistant: Please provide details about the patient's clinical background, including any recent imaging or lab results, and the reason why you're considering the MRI.
User: Patient is a 32-year-old who had acute myocarditis six weeks ago. Ejection fraction was 40% during the acute phase, troponins are now normal, and the patient only reports mild persistent fatigue without chest pain. ECG is stable with no current arrhythmias. We want to see if residual inflammation or diminished function might still be present. A repeat echocardiogram is an alternative test. Should we proceed with a cardiac MRI or is the echo sufficient?
