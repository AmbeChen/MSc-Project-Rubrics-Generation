On 09/01/2023, father asked if the child might have ADHD or some other reason for difficulty focusing, no documented comorbidities. On 09/10/2023, father requested a formal note explaining possible causes for the child's trouble focusing. Child is otherwise healthy. On 09/15/2023, father demanded a diagnosis and plan, but there is no reported history of anxiety, no changes in medication, no reported social or academic stress.
