User: i am an obstetrician in a small rural hospital my postpartum patient is 23 years old she delivered a baby a couple hours ago and she started bleeding heavily we gave oxytocin and misoprostol plus two units of blood but her blood pressure is still dropping to 80 over 40 her heart rate is 150 and she is looking very pale and confused the uterine massage is not reducing the hemorrhage and our blood supply is nearly depleted we tried fluid resuscitation but her vitals keep worsening she is in shock please tell me what exactly is happening
