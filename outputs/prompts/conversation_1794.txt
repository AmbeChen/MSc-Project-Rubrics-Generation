User: borderline iop significance
Assistant: It seems like you’re asking about borderline high intraocular pressure (IOP). Could you clarify if your eye doctor mentioned any concern about glaucoma or asked you to follow up? For now, here’s a general outline of what borderline IOP could mean:

### Typical IOP Range
1. **Normal pressure** is often between 10 and 21 mmHg.
2. **Borderline or high-normal** could be in the low- to mid-20s.

### Possible Reasons
1. **Thick corneas** can artificially elevate measured pressure.
2. **Family history or other risk factors** could raise concern.
3. **Monitoring** is usually recommended if pressures are consistently in the borderline range.

### Next Steps
1. **Repeat measurements** to confirm.
2. **Visual field testing** to check for early signs of glaucoma.
3. **Further evaluations** like optical coherence tomography (OCT) for the optic nerve.

Let me know if this addresses your question or if you want more specifics!
