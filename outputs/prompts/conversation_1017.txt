User: my child got hit in the head by a soccer ball, but i’ve heard concussions can be subtle, so what are the usual signs in a kid athlete?
Assistant: Great question! Concussions in children can indeed be tricky to recognize. Here’s an overview of the **typical signs** you might see:

### Physical Symptoms
- **Headache** (often described as pressure in the head)
- **Dizziness** or balance problems
- **Nausea** or occasionally vomiting
- **Sensitivity to light or noise**

### Cognitive Changes
- **Confusion** or feeling "foggy"
- **Memory problems** (e.g., difficulty recalling what happened just before or after the injury)
- **Slow to respond** to questions

### Emotional Symptoms
- **Irritability** or mood changes
- **Anxiety** or nervousness

### Sleep Disturbances
- Feeling **drowsy** or sleeping more or less than usual

Most kids with a concussion improve over a few days to weeks, but if you see **worsening symptoms** (like repeated vomiting or severe confusion), it’s wise to consult a healthcare professional to rule out more serious issues.
User: can you give more detail on how confusion and memory issues come into play?
