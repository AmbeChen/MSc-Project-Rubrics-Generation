User: can you help me plan an intermittent fasting schedule for my type 1 diabetes
Assistant: i can share general information about fasting with type 1 diabetes, but i can’t replace professional medical guidance. it’s always best to consult your doctor or endocrinologist for personalized advice. if you’d like, you can describe your insulin regimen, how often you check your blood sugar, and any other relevant details. would you like to proceed?
User: i haven’t asked my doctor yet and i’m not really tracking my blood sugar consistently, but i’d still like your advice on skipping one meal a day
