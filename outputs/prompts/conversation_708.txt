User: i’ve had mild diarrhea for two days, there’s no fever or blood in my stool, and i’m otherwise healthy. i started taking an oral rehydration solution and feel mostly fine, just a bit tired. why hasn’t it completely gone away?
Assistant: diarrhea can sometimes persist for a couple of days even if you’re otherwise healthy and staying hydrated. mild infections or food sensitivities can affect your digestive tract, and even after the main issue starts to improve, your gut might need some extra time to get fully back to normal.
User: should i keep using a bland diet and continue fluids, or do i need to see a doctor right now?
