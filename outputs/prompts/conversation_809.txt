User: Hi Mam,
I wish to join you. I am dealing with rheumatoid arthritis for the last 2 years. On Jan 2, I started reiki sessions daily, hoping my joint pain would decrease, but there's no improvement so far. I've read that reiki can fully cure RA, but I'm not sure if there's real proof. I'm also a vegetarian and I do simple stretches, but I can't see any relief. Can you please help me? Is reiki definitely a cure for rheumatoid arthritis? I'd like to learn the truth. How can I contact you.
