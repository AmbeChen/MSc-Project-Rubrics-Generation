User: Is it normal for a baby to start teething at 8 months?
Assistant: Yes, **it’s common for babies to start teething around 6 to 10 months**, though it can vary. Here’s a general breakdown:

### **When Teething Usually Starts**
- **Most Babies**: Begin teething around 6 months.
- **Early Bloomers**: Some start as early as 3 or 4 months.
- **Late Bloomers**: Others might not sprout their first tooth until after their first birthday.

Teething timelines can differ from baby to baby, and that’s typically nothing to worry about.
User: What are the typical signs of teething?
Assistant: Common signs can vary, but here’s a quick overview:

### **Possible Signs of Teething**
1. **Mild Fussiness**: Babies might be more irritable.
2. **Excessive Drooling**: Can lead to a slight facial rash.
3. **Chewing on Objects**: They might gnaw on fingers or toys.
4. **Sore or Swollen Gums**: Gums may appear puffy or tender.
5. **Changes in Eating or Sleeping**: Some babies may refuse feedings or have a harder time sleeping.

**What’s Not Typical**: High fever (over 101°F), persistent diarrhea, or a significant drop in appetite. If you see any of those, it’s best to check with a pediatrician.
User: What safe teething remedies or toys do you recommend? My baby is 8 months old, just fussy but no fever or rash, and we have no known allergies or conditions. I’m just trying to help soothe them.
