Assistant: The citation you provided is from the **ACOG 2023 Practice Bulletin** on gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, which outlines updated recommendations for diagnosing and managing these conditions to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.
User: based on these guidelines can you summarize the BP cutoffs that define preeclampsia and the recommended initial labs for evaluation
Assistant: According to the **ACOG 2023 Practice Bulletin**:

- **Blood pressure thresholds** for preeclampsia generally include BP â‰¥140/90 mm Hg on two occasions at least four hours apart in a previously normotensive individual.
- **Initial lab tests** typically include:
  - Complete blood count to assess for hemolysis or platelet count abnormalities.
  - Liver function tests (AST, ALT).
  - Serum creatinine to evaluate renal function.
  - Assessment of proteinuria via 24-hour urine protein collection or spot protein/creatinine ratio.

These steps help determine the presence and severity of preeclampsia and guide management decisions.
User: i'm writing an urgent OB triage note for suspected preeclampsia with severe features and need a structured note referencing the recommended labs BP thresholds possible severe features and the correct ICD-10 code for preeclampsia
