User: I have this teenage patient who came in an hour ago with sudden, severe testicular pain and he looks really uncomfortable. I'm a pediatric urology fellow, and I'm worried it could be something like torsion.
Assistant: I’m sorry to hear he’s in so much pain—it’s definitely concerning when it comes on so quickly. Sudden, severe testicular pain can mean several things, including torsion, which is an emergency. Has he mentioned if there’s any nausea or if the pain is getting even worse?
User: Yes, he’s nauseous and says it’s the worst pain he’s ever felt. The testicle looks a bit higher than usual and feels very tender, almost like it’s up in the groin region.
Assistant: Got it—testicular elevation plus severe tenderness sounds serious. If it’s torsion, time is critical because the blood flow to the testis can be cut off, risking permanent damage. Is there any discoloration or swelling?
User: Yes, there’s some swelling and a little redness on the scrotum. He can barely stand, and I’m concerned we might not have much time.
Assistant: That definitely raises alarms. Typically, we’d do an urgent Doppler ultrasound to check blood flow, but if you’re strongly suspecting torsion, you don’t want to delay treatment. What does the ultrasound show so far?
User: We did a quick ultrasound—there was very little blood flow to the affected side, basically absent flow. He’s grimacing and gripping his side in pain.
Assistant: I’m so sorry he’s in that state. Absent blood flow means we have to think about immediate surgical intervention. If it truly is torsion, the window to save the testicle can be a few hours at most. How long has this been going on again?
User: Just about an hour so far, but the pain keeps intensifying. Should I rush him for emergent surgical exploration right now, or is there any other step I can do first?
