User: Migraine med to  handle daily throbbing
Assistant: For ongoing headaches that you suspect are migraines, some medications focus on acute symptom relief, while others help prevent attacks.

1. **Acute treatments**: Triptans (e.g., sumatriptan), NSAIDs, or combination analgesics for pain episodes.
2. **Preventive therapy**: Certain anticonvulsants (like topiramate), beta-blockers, or antidepressants for frequent migraines.

Choosing depends on diagnosis, medical history, and side effects. A healthcare provider can help decide the best plan.
