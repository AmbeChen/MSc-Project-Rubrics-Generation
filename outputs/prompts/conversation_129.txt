User: What does it call if someone has too much weight
Assistant: When a person has excessive weight that can lead to health problems, it’s typically called obesity. Obesity can increase the risk of conditions like heart disease and diabetes. A health professional can measure a person’s body mass index (BMI) to assess obesity and discuss ways to manage it.
