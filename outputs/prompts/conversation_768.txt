User: The patient is on Omeprazole for repeated episodes of heartburn over the past week. We have not assessed the severity of the discomfort or whether the antacids are helping. We have not confirmed if there is any difficulty swallowing or chest pain. I suggest continuing Omeprazole for now; however, I am concerned we may be missing signs of an underlying serious issue. Labs and allergies were briefly reviewed. Case was discussed with the nurse. Plan of care was discussed with the patient, who agrees with the current approach. Omeprazole is correct ?
