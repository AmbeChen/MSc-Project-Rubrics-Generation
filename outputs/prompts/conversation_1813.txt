User: how do i remove a small splinter from my finger it’s not that deep but it’s bugging me
Assistant: for a small splinter that’s close to the surface, here’s a usual approach:

1. wash your hands and the area with soap and water
2. use clean tweezers to gently pull the splinter out—grab it at the exposed end, if you can
3. if it’s deeper, you can use a sterilized needle to lift it slightly so you can grab it with tweezers
4. clean the area again afterward, and cover it if necessary until it heals
User: should i clean it with something first or is it safe to just yank it out
