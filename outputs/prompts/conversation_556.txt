User: 72 y/o with advanced heart failure on furosemide 40 mg BID, recently gained 3 kg, mild hypotension. I'd like next steps
Assistant: For an advanced heart failure patient with weight gain and mild hypotension on loop diuretics, here are key considerations:

### 1. **Assess Volume Status**
   - Physical exam (jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema).
   - Adjust diuretic dosing or frequency if signs of volume overload.

### 2. **Electrolytes & Renal Function**
   - Frequent monitoring of BUN, creatinine, potassium.
   - Watch for diuretic-induced electrolyte imbalances.

### 3. **Blood Pressure**
   - If hypotension is symptomatic, titrate diuretics carefully.
   - Consider adjusting other HF medications based on clinical goals.

### 4. **Guideline-Directed Care**
   - Evaluate for medications like ACE inhibitors/ARBs or ARNIs, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists.

These steps can help refine management of diuretic therapy and maintain optimal volume status.
User: BUN 42 mg/dL, creatinine 2.1 mg/dL, mild hypotension. I'd like a structured approach referencing guidelines
Assistant: Given the elevated BUN and creatinine, plus hypotension, here is an overview:

### 1. **Volume Assessment**
   - **Goal**: Optimize euvolemia without causing prerenal azotemia.
   - Watch for signs of low perfusion vs. fluid retention.

### 2. **Diuretic Adjustments**
   - Potentially split or reduce doses if hypotension persists.
   - Consider adding thiazide-like diuretic cautiously if resistant edema.

### 3. **Renal Function Monitoring**
   - Track changes in BUN and creatinine.
   - Evaluate for reversible factors (e.g., NSAIDs, dehydration, etc.).

### 4. **Guideline References**
   - According to ACC/AHA guidance, emphasis on maintaining adequate perfusion while preventing volume overload.
   - Avoid over-diuresis that could worsen renal function.

Balancing these factors helps guide safe diuretic therapy in advanced HF.
User: We also want to consider an MRA. I'd like a final structured note referencing the 2022 ACC/AHA HF guidelines and detailing the rationale for each medication change.
