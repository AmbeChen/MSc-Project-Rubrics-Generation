User: I’ve been doing therapy for my anxiety under the scottish nhs in glasgow but i’m getting worse and i’d like a referral to a psychiatrist soon are the wait times really long or is there a local mental health team to see sooner i’m worried i’ll be stuck on a list for months and i want to know if there’s a way to get help faster
