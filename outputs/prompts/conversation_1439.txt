User: sudden dizziness differential diagnosis
Assistant: Sudden dizziness can have multiple causes:

### 1. Inner Ear or Vestibular Issues
- Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)
- Labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis

### 2. Cardiovascular Causes
- Orthostatic hypotension (quick drop in blood pressure on standing)
- Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)

### 3. Neurological Conditions
- Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) affecting the posterior circulation
- Migraines causing vestibular symptoms

### 4. Metabolic Factors
- Low blood sugar
- Dehydration

### Additional Considerations
- Recent infections, medications, or injuries
- High stress or lack of rest

Evaluation often involves a medical history, physical exam, and possibly imaging or blood tests, depending on the presentation severity and associated symptoms.
