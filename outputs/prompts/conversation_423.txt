User: In the past year, I’ve treated several patients with advanced stage chronic kidney disease who are waiting for transplants. I came across partial kidney replacement devices that are supposed to help individuals avoid or reduce standard dialysis sessions, but so far, all I’ve seen are small pilot studies with inconclusive findings. I’ve found no large-scale randomized trials or robust observational data. Some patients are asking if these partial devices can really extend the time to transplantation or significantly improve their quality of life.
I’m looking for professional guidance on whether partial kidney replacement is truly beneficial or if we should wait until more concrete data emerges, given how limited the current research is. Thank you.
