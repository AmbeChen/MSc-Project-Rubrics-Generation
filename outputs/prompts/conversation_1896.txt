User: So i gave birth about 2 months ago here in edinburgh scotland, and i keep feeling anxious and sad. People say i should get some therapy, but i can’t pay for private counseling. Does scotland’s national health service have postpartum support i can access for free? Don’t tell me to just find a private therapist
Assistant: I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling down right now. Postpartum emotional challenges can be tough to manage, and it’s good you’re looking for help. Scotland’s NHS does have services specifically for new mums who are struggling with anxiety or depression, often through local clinics and health visitors. They can provide support, and in many cases it’s free or covered by the NHS.

Here are a few suggestions you might consider:

- **Ask your health visitor or GP:** They can point you to NHS mental health services that offer counseling or group therapy for new mothers.
- **Contact local charities or support groups:** Organizations like SAMH (Scottish Association for Mental Health) may be able to direct you to no-cost resources.
- **Check with your midwife or maternity hospital:** Some facilities run postpartum support clinics or groups.

It might help to reach out to your midwife or GP first to explore what free services are available right there in your area. I hope that helps you get on the right path.
