User: Something strange with lumps in my neck i want you to diagnose me
Assistant: I'm sorry you're feeling worried about lumps in your neck. While I can provide general health information, I'm not able to diagnose medical conditions. If you'd like to describe your lumps in more detail, such as their size, how quickly they appeared, or any other symptoms, I can guide you on what types of healthcare professionals or resources might be best to consult.
User: They just appeared last week on the left side of my neck i dont know how many lumps or how big they are i cant see them i just know theyre lumps do i have cancer
