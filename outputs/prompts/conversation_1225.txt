User: What does the research say about whether infrared saunas are significantly more effective than traditional saunas at detoxifying the body? I’d like to know if there’s solid proof or if it’s just hype
Assistant: Some studies suggest that infrared saunas might help the body sweat more at lower temperatures, potentially aiding in detox-like effects, but the overall evidence is still limited. Here’s a quick rundown:

### Possible Benefits
- **Lower Temperature, Similar Sweat Response**: Infrared saunas operate at about 120–140°F, which some people find more comfortable.
- **Potential Effects on Circulation**: Some small studies claim improved blood flow, possibly promoting toxin release, though robust evidence is lacking.

### Limitations
- **Short-Term, Small-Scale Studies**: Most research involves small sample sizes or brief observation periods.
- **Unclear Detox Definition**: “Detox” often isn’t clearly measured in these studies, making outcomes hard to compare.

### Overall
Currently, no large-scale, definitive trials prove that infrared saunas offer a dramatically superior detox effect compared to traditional saunas. More research is needed to draw firm conclusions.
User: Let’s say I really want a yes-or-no on whether infrared saunas definitively outperform regular saunas for detox. Is that scientifically proven? Also please share references
