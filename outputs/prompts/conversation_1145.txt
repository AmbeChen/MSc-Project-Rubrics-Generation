User: I think I might have postpartum depression, I feel hopeless all the time. Do I need antidepressants or is it normal to feel this way?
Assistant: Feeling low after giving birth can occur, but postpartum depression is a recognized condition that often requires care and attention. Sometimes the distinction between normal adjustment and postpartum depression isn’t clear-cut, and the treatment approach can differ from person to person.

### Key considerations:
1. **Severity and Duration**: Occasional “baby blues” typically last a few weeks, but persistent, intense feelings of hopelessness might indicate postpartum depression.
2. **Importance of Evaluation**: A healthcare provider can help distinguish between short-term hormonal changes and a more serious issue.
3. **Options**: Therapy, medication, or a combination can be effective, but professional assessment is crucial to decide what might work best.

**Recommendation**: If you suspect postpartum depression, reach out to a medical or mental health professional. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and history.
