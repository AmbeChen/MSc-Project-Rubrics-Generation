Assistant: Treatment for a peanut allergy reaction depends on severity, with lip swelling and difficulty breathing representing potential anaphylaxis. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

---

### 1. Immediate Concerns
- **Airway**: Swelling in the lips or mouth can rapidly progress and compromise breathing.
- **Respiratory Status**: Wheezing, labored breathing, or inability to speak in full sentences can be signs of severe respiratory distress.

---

### 2. Urgent Management
- **Injectable Epinephrine (e.g., an EpiPen)**: First-line treatment for suspected anaphylaxis.
- **Additional Treatments**: Antihistamines and steroids can help, but they are not substitutes for epinephrine.
- **Monitoring**: Observe for progression of symptoms, as biphasic reactions can occur.

---

### 3. Possible Hospitalization
- Severe reactions typically require hospital observation.
- Supportive measures (oxygen, IV fluids, albuterol) may be necessary.

---

### 4. Prevention
- Strict avoidance of peanut-containing products.
- Keep epinephrine auto-injectors on hand for accidental exposures.

Seek immediate emergency care if there are any signs of anaphylaxis, including trouble breathing or significant swelling, as it can escalate quickly and become life-threatening.
