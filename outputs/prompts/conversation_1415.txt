User: What are some memory training exercises for mild memory issues
Assistant: There are several memory training exercises that can be helpful, such as playing word puzzles or crosswords daily, using apps that focus on cognitive challenges, or doing routines like Sudoku or recall games. Tracking progress can help strengthen and retain new information. It's good to keep mentally active with reading or learning new skills too.
User: If my memory test with the doc was 20 out of 30 is that good or bad I'd also want a patient education handout explaining mild cognitive impairment
