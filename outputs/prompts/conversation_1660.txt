User: Aspirin uses
Assistant: Aspirin is a common medication with several key uses:

1. **Pain relief**: Helps alleviate headaches, muscle aches, and minor arthritis pain.
2. **Fever reducer**: Lowers elevated temperature in mild infections.
3. **Anti-inflammatory**: Reduces inflammation in conditions like bursitis or tendonitis.
4. **Blood thinner**: In low doses, it can help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular events.

**Cautions**:
- Possible stomach irritation or ulcers if taken excessively.
- May increase bleeding risk.
- Always consult a doctor, especially if you have a bleeding disorder or a history of ulcers.
- Use cautiously if youâ€™re on other medications affecting blood clotting.

- Less anti-inflammatory effect.
- Generally gentle on the stomach and less likely to cause ulcers.
- Overuse can affect the liver, so avoid exceeding recommended doses.

**Ibuprofen**:
- Relieves pain, lowers fever, and reduces inflammation.
- Belongs to the NSAID class, which can sometimes irritate the stomach.
- Overuse can affect the kidneys and may lead to stomach ulcers or bleeding.

**Choosing Which to Use**:
- Acetaminophen is often preferred for fever and mild pain, particularly in people prone to stomach issues.
