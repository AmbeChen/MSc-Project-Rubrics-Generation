User: Is it okay to rinse a small burn in cold water? I touched a hot pan, and the skin on my fingertip got red but no blister.
Assistant: Yes, running cool (not ice-cold) water over a minor burn can help soothe discomfort and lower the skin temperature, which may prevent further damage. It also helps clean the area gently. As long as it’s just redness without blistering, that’s usually considered a mild, superficial burn.
User: What if the burn is just on the tip of my index finger with no open wounds or blisters, and it’s smaller than a dime?
Assistant: That typically indicates a first-degree burn—redness, mild swelling, or tenderness but no open wound. For something small and superficial like that, cool water and a gentle cleansing can help. You might notice some soreness for a day or two, but if it’s small and isn’t forming any blisters, it’s likely to heal well.
User: I have no history of skin issues, and it just feels a bit sore. If I rinse it and put a store-bought ointment, do I need to do anything else, or is that enough?
