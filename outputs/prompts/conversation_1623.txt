User: I’ve had persistent diarrhea for about two weeks now, and I live in Redwood Lake, Pennsylvania, where we rely on local mountain stream water that isn’t really treated. I know giardia is pretty common in this region. I’m trying to figure out if I might have giardiasis or if something else could be causing my symptoms. Also, I’d like to know the best way to confirm if it’s giardia.
Assistant: Giardiasis is indeed a known risk in areas that rely on untreated water sources, such as mountain streams. Generally, the diagnosis involves stool sample tests to identify the parasite or its antigens. Some other possibilities for persistent diarrhea might include bacterial infections or inflammatory conditions, but given the local prevalence of giardia, that’s often the first consideration here.
User: I had just tested the water’s pH level, but that was unforeseen and doesn’t necessarily mean it’s safe to drink. I’m traveling in a couple of days and might not have time to visit a local clinic in Redwood Lake, Pennsylvania. Should I try to get a quick test kit, or do I absolutely need a stool sample at a lab? Also, do I need a prescription for typical giardia treatment, or can I handle it on my own? If you were in my situation, what would you do next?
