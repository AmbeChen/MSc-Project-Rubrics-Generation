User: Hello, I’m struggling with whether I should keep breastfeeding or switch to formula. My baby seems to fuss all the time, especially after feedings, and I’m feeling completely exhausted. I’m worried I might not be producing enough milk because whenever I pump, it doesn’t seem like I get much. The doctor hasn’t given me a clear answer on whether continuing to breastfeed is best, or if I should try formula instead.
