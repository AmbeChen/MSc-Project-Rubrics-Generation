User: I started taking over-the-counter antihistamines for my allergies, and now I feel drowsy all day. Why do they make me so sleepy?
Assistant: Some antihistamines, especially older ones, can cross from the bloodstream into the brain, and that can make you feel sedated. They work by blocking the action of histamine, which is involved in the body’s allergic response, but also in helping you stay awake and alert. So when that pathway is blocked, it can leave you feeling more tired than usual.
User: Is there a version that doesn’t make me so tired? I’d really like to treat my allergies without nodding off.
