User: i'm writing a short piece for a pediatrics blog roughly titled persistent projectile vomiting in early infancy. i want to detail five possible differential diagnoses including pyloric stenosis, gastroesophageal reflux, metabolic disorders, infection, and anatomical anomalies. i also want to describe how to decide among them clinically, highlight any red flags (like blood in vomit or severe dehydration), and recommend next steps for diagnosis and management. please list them in bullet points mentioning typical presentations, relevant labs or imaging, and potential treatments.
