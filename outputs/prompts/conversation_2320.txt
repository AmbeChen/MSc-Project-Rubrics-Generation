User: Possible next steps for my blood pressure management:
Week 1: 145/90 in the morning, around 135/82 in the evening
Week 2: 148/92 in the morning, 138/85 in the evening
Medication: Lisinopril 20 mg daily (for about 2 months)
Lifestyle changes: drastically reduced salt, 30-min daily walks, cut back on caffeine
Iâ€™ve noticed a mild cough at night. Should I consider switching from an ACE inhibitor to a different class?
