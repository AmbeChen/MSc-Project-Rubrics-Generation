User: I have a question regarding something I am experiencing in my arms. For the past few days, they have been extremely itchy, to the point that I am forced to scratch nonstop. Sometimes it feels like it might be dryness or an allergic reaction, but Iâ€™m really not sure. Do you have any ideas of what this could be?
