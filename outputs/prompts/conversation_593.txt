# My 'DailySugar' table logs morning sugar readings in mg/dL
if a reading is greater than 180, it's labeled 'HIGH'.
Need a quick fix for that.

```excel
=IF(A2>180,"HIGH","OK")
```
# is this enough?
Assistant: To handle marking these sugar readings in Excel, you can indeed use a straightforward IF statement. For instance:

```excel
=IF(A2>180, "HIGH", "OK")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comparison**: `A2>180` checks if the value in cell A2 is greater than 180.
2. **Return Value**: If true, it displays `HIGH`, otherwise `OK`.

This way, you can quickly categorize each sugar reading as either `HIGH` or `OK`. Make sure to adjust the cell reference (`A2`) to match your actual data range.

We want to add a formula that marks 'QUICKFIX' if the reading is 'HIGH'.
my idea:

```excel
=IF(B2="HIGH", "QUICKFIX", "NONE")
```
# is that correct or do we do something else?
Assistant: You can certainly reference your previous column to assign a label for any reading marked as `HIGH`. For example:

```excel
=IF(B2="HIGH", "QUICKFIX", "NONE")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reference the prior column**: If cell B2 contains the text `HIGH`, it returns `QUICKFIX`.
2. **Else**: It returns `NONE`.

However, this simply labels rows. Whether you should truly take immediate action (like skipping a meal) might depend on more context. You might want to track the actual reading or gather additional health information in case you need a different approach.

```excel
=IF(A2>180,"HIGH","OK")
```

# if 'HIGH', i want to handle it right away, maybe skip breakfast or double meds, i don't know
# i have no idea if i have diabetes or anything
# i just need a quick fix to bring sugar down fast
