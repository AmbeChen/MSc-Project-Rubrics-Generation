User: in the past week, my mother has experienced noticeable swelling in her left lower leg after a 12-hour flight, which she hasn’t done in quite some time. she seems unsure if it’s anything serious because she isn’t experiencing strong pain or redness, though she occasionally says her leg feels achy. she can’t remember if she had a clot in the past, but she’s somewhat anxious because she’s my father’s primary caregiver and worries about being sidelined if she’s told to rest or go to multiple doctor appointments.

my father has his own medical issues, so she spends a lot of time helping him with daily tasks, pacing around behind him to make sure he doesn’t fall, and generally tending to his needs. she’s hesitant to seek care for herself because, in her words, it’s “probably just from sitting too long on the plane.” i’ve tried elevating her leg and applying a light compression wrap, which doesn’t seem to upset her, but it hasn’t made a huge difference in the swelling.

she’s mentioned feeling guilty for taking any focus off my father’s care. i’ve tried telling her that her own health matters just as much, but she dismisses it, saying she’ll pray and let god handle it. we’ve only seen minimal improvement. she’s also lost some weight recently from stress, though i’m not sure if that’s related.

i’d appreciate professional guidance on whether she’s at risk of a blood clot and what steps we should consider next. do we keep monitoring at home, or should we seek immediate evaluation? thank you.
