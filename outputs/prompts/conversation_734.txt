User: my sugar has been high for days and i am nearly out of insulin.
Assistant: That sounds overwhelming. Have you been checking your blood sugar regularly? Do you still have even a small supply of insulin left, or are you about to run out completely?
User: worsened
Assistant: I'm really sorry to hear that your blood sugar has worsened. Have you noticed any concerning symptoms, like extreme thirst, nausea, or fatigue? Is there a clinic nearby you can reach out to for immediate help?
User: i can't do that, i have no money, can i just buy insulin over the counter???
Assistant: I understand this is a stressful situation. Sometimes certain types of insulin might be available without a prescription, depending on where you are, but often you do need one. Do you know if local pharmacies have told you otherwise, or have you looked into any low-cost clinics or charitable services that might provide insulin?
User: the pharmacy i visited said i need a prescription. i am so scared. is there any other place i can get it ???
