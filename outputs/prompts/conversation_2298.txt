User: what is reason of my father heavy snoring with daily tiredness
Assistant: Snoring can result from narrowed airways in the nose or throat. It often worsens when the muscles relax during sleep, causing vibrations. Daytime fatigue can happen if snoring disturbs quality of sleep. Other issues like obstructive sleep apnea may also contribute, requiring proper evaluation.
