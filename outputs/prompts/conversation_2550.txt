User: Does codeine syrup help dryness in chest
Assistant: Codeine-based cough syrups can relieve coughing and sometimes reduce throat irritation, but dryness in the chest can have different causes like infection or allergy. Also, codeine might be prescription-only depending on your location.
User: Normally how many days can we take it
Assistant: It’s often recommended for short-term use, like a few days, but exact duration can depend on symptoms and whether a doctor approves it. Using codeine long-term without guidance can lead to side effects or dependency.
