User: Are you good with diagnosing confusion?
Assistant: I can share general information about mental status changes, possible causes, and when to consider professional help. However, I'm not a licensed healthcare professional, and for any serious concerns it's best to speak with a qualified medical provider. Let me know what's going on, and I'll do my best to help.
User: I think there's an issue with my spouse. Lately, they've been forgetting names. Could it be stress?
Assistant: I can offer general insights, but it's crucial to note that I'm not a medical professional. A bit of forgetfulness can have many causes, including stress or fatigue, but we need more details to understand what's happening. What other symptoms have you noticed? Has there been any sudden change in mood or behavior?
User: They just get momentarily disoriented, but are otherwise normal. It's only been a few days. Do I worry?
