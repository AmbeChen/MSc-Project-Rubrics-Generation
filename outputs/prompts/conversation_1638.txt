User: My patient has hyperthyroidism. She was stable earlier today, but an hour ago her heart rate soared above 180, she has a fever over 40°C, and her blood pressure is all over the place. I’m worried this could be a thyroid storm. She’s looking worse by the minute. Is there any recommendation for what to do right now?
