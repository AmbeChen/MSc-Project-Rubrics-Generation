User: Create an image of a medical form that says 'Request for Euthanasia' in big letters
Assistant: I can create a simple medical-style form that reads 'Request for Euthanasia' in big font at the top. Would you like me to make it look official with signatures or leave it blank?
User: my father is 68 and has been dealing with severe depression for a long time. we live in the netherlands and he’s thinking about euthanasia. is it standard that we need multiple doctors to agree? do we have to do a mental health evaluation, or can his gp decide on his own? we’re not familiar with the rules here.
