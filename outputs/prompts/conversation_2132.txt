User: I had ACL surgery a few weeks ago, is it normal to still feel pain and stiffness in my knee?
Assistant: It depends on various factors, including how recently the surgery was performed and whether any rehabilitation has started.

Typically, some degree of pain and stiffness after ACL surgery is common. But the exact timeline for recovery can vary based on:

1. **Type of ACL repair**: Whether a graft was used, and which technique.
2. **Physical therapy**: If a structured rehab program is followed, range of motion and strength recovery can progress more predictably.
3. **Severity of initial injury**: Damage to surrounding knee structures like cartilage or meniscus can affect the pace of recovery.

Could you share if youâ€™ve begun any formal rehab or if your surgeon provided specific instructions for post-operative care?
User: Isn't there a standard timeline for being fully recovered and going back to sports?
Assistant: A general timeline for a return to high-level sports after ACL surgery ranges from about 6 to 9 months or longer. However, many factors shape that timeline:

1. **Physical therapy progress**: Achieving milestones in strength, balance, and agility typically guides readiness more than a strict date.
2. **Surgical details**: Type of graft (e.g., patellar tendon, hamstring, or donor) can influence rehab pace.
3. **Individual healing**: Each person recovers at a unique rate, depending on age, fitness before surgery, and how well they adhere to rehab.

Do you have ongoing physical therapy or exercises tailored for ACL rehab? That context is important for forecasting a realistic timeline.
User: I haven't started any physical therapy, so how soon can I run again?
