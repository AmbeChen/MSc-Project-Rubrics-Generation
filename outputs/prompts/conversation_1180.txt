User: Is it normal to have a telehealth appointment to adjust ADHD medication?
Assistant: Yes, it’s fairly common nowadays. Telehealth can be convenient, especially if you’ve already been diagnosed and just need to modify your treatment plan. Of course, it’s always best to confirm details with your healthcare provider.
User: Here’s the transcript from my recent telehealth reevaluation. Convert it into a structured clinic visit note:

"Patient is a 25-year-old returning for ADHD management. Has been on 15 mg of immediate-release Adderall daily for the past four months. Reports good control of symptoms in the morning, but notices difficulty focusing again by mid-afternoon. Denies significant side effects, though mentions mild appetite suppression. Denies mood changes. Physical exam was not performed as this was a virtual visit.

Clinician acknowledges the need to optimize afternoon coverage. Suggests increasing the dose to 20 mg daily, instructing to monitor for any change in side effects. Advises continuing regular counseling sessions. Next follow-up in four weeks. Additional non-stimulant options to be considered if issues persist."
