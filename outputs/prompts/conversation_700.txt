User: I have a 40-year-old patient who presented with a rapid onset of confusion, several episodes of seizures, and white matter lesions on MRI over the past two weeks. I'm leaning toward a less common bacterial encephalitis—maybe Listeria or Bartonella—given that preliminary tests haven't confirmed anything typical. I'd like to mention:

1) The patient has no known immunocompromise but is experiencing rapid neurological decline and we haven't fully ruled out more typical pathogens yet.
2) We’re particularly concerned about diagnosing Listeria or Bartonella, so I'd like your recommendations for confirmatory testing (CSF PCR or additional serologies?).
3) I'm hoping for guidance on antibiotic selection and duration—should we begin empiric coverage with ampicillin and possibly consider adjunctive treatments?

Thank you for your help, Dr. Jackson. Please draft a concise but comprehensive consult note that I can send to your team, summarizing these concerns and asking for your recommendations on both the diagnostic and therapeutic approach.
