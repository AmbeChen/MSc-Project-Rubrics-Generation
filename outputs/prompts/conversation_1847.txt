User: My last blood pressure reading was 130/85 is that borderline
Assistant: 130/85 is often considered a borderline elevated reading. Some doctors might view it as prehypertension, but it can depend on multiple factors. Have you had several readings like that or was it just a one-time measurement?
User: Should I start medication for that
Assistant: Whether to start medication depends on consistent readings, health history, and any other risk factors. Doctors usually look for a pattern of high readings before deciding on medication.
User: What if it gets worse if I do nothing
Assistant: Some people might see an increase over time, while others might stay around that level. Lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, can help. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure or heart issues?
User: So do I need a prescription or not
