User: Shivering for hours vs normal chills
Assistant: Shivering can arise from various causes, ranging from mild chills to more serious conditions:

### **Normal Chills**
- **Definition**: Typically a brief, involuntary trembling that occurs when you’re cold or experiencing a mild infection.
- **Causes**: Low ambient temperature, a common cold, or mild fever.
- **Characteristics**: Often improves with warming measures (like a blanket) or after an infection subsides.

### **Extended Shivering**
- **Possible Indicators**: If you are shivering for hours and it’s not easily resolved by warming measures, it could be a sign of a significant drop in body temperature, severe infection, or other metabolic issues.
- **Associated Symptoms**: Extreme fatigue, confusion, or persistent inability to warm up.
- **When to Seek Help**: If shivering is accompanied by disorientation, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or bluish skin, it can suggest a more urgent concern.

Though many cases of shivering are related to mild or transient reasons, it’s important to monitor how long it lasts, how severe it is, and whether additional symptoms appear.
