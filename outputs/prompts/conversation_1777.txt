User: Can you decipher this for me as a psychologist would, it's about my father from a caretaker's notes: Appearance and Behaviour: Lying in bed with eyes closed, no sign of response to voice or touch, no obvious movements. No mention of whether he's breathing normally or if he has any chronic medical conditions. No speech or reaction to external cues. During the observation, there's no indication he was merely asleep; he did not stir, open his eyes, or acknowledge the environment. I'm really concerned about what this might mean.
