User: any tips on selecting an icd-10 code for a depressed patient no additional info just that the note says the patient is depressed
Assistant: Depression can be documented under multiple ICD-10 codes depending on whether it is major depression, adjustment disorder, dysthymia, or another category, which often requires details about severity (mild, moderate, severe), presence of psychotic features, and duration. If all you have is a note stating “the patient is depressed,” that may not be sufficient to accurately select a code without additional clinical details. Typically, you’d want to confirm:

1. **Diagnosis Type**: Major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, dysthymia, or other.
2. **Severity**: Mild, moderate, or severe.
3. **Recurrent Episodes**: Has the patient had previous episodes?
4. **Additional Specifiers**: Features like anxiety, psychosis, postpartum onset, etc.

Without these details, you may not be able to pinpoint the correct ICD-10 code. Document any missing elements to ensure proper coding.
