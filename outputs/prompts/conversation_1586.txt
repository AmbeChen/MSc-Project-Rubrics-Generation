User: I'm a 30-year-old female who was diagnosed with mild depression by my therapist about a year ago. I attend weekly therapy sessions, my treatment hasn't changed in months, and my doctor says I’m stable with no suicidal thoughts. I'd like extra self-care ideas to manage stress between sessions—maybe tips for daily routines, any exercises or diet suggestions, and other ways to cope. What do you think would help me?
