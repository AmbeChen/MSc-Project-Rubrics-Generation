User: Help me figure out if I’m giving the correct dose to my 4-year-old for her ear infection. She weighs 36 pounds, the pediatrician wrote in big letters 400 mg of amoxicillin twice a day for 10 days, so I’ve been giving her the first dose around 9am and the second around 9pm. She doesn’t seem to have side effects, but I’m worried I might be missing something. I’m on day 2 and freaking out. Let me know if there’s something else I should do or if I’m fine to keep going with this dose.
