User: Summarize <PRIVATE_PERSON> was told by their doctor they have appendicitis. They did not mention how long they have had their abdominal pain or what imaging was done. They have no known comorbidities but are not sure. They are asking whether it is best to have surgery or to use medications for treatment. They only want the best approach for their appendicitis.
