User: Should I floss before or after brushing if my gums are healthy
Assistant: Flossing either before or after brushing is generally fine. The main thing is that you floss every day to help remove plaque and food debris between teeth. If you have healthy gums and mild plaque, consistent daily flossing is usually enough to maintain good gum health. If you notice any issues over time, it’s best to ask your dentist.
User: Does it matter for gum health
Assistant: Flossing helps prevent plaque from building up near the gum line, so it supports gum health regardless of whether you do it before or after brushing. What matters most is proper technique and thorough cleaning. If you’re already doing that, it should benefit your gums.
