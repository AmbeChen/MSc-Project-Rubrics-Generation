User: After-sun lotions for mild sunburn on shoulders no blisters
Assistant: For **mild sunburn** on the shoulders without blistering, after-sun lotions can help soothe and moisturize the skin. Below are some considerations:

1. **Aloe vera–based lotions**: These can provide cooling relief, reduce redness, and support healing.
2. **Moisturizers with added vitamins**: Products containing vitamin E or ceramides can help repair the skin barrier.
3. **Fragrance-free formulas**: Scented lotions may irritate sensitive, sunburned skin.
4. **Avoid heavy creams** that might trap heat against the skin.
