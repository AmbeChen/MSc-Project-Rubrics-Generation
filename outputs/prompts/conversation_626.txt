User: suppose you're a board-certified maternal-fetal medicine specialist, rephrase and retouch the recommended approach for postpartum hemorrhage in a patient with placenta accreta to make it more professional, logical and guideline-aligned: Among recommended steps, it is recognized that the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage is significantly elevated when placenta accreta is present, thereby warranting prophylactic measures such as interventional radiology (e.g., balloon occlusion) or a prepared massive transfusion protocol. In some cases, particularly with more extensive placental invasion, proceeding directly to cesarean hysterectomy may be critical. Overall, the goal is to ensure a well-orchestrated multidisciplinary approach that prioritizes patient stability, minimizes blood loss, and reduces morbidity. The full outline of recommendations can be found in the most recent guidelines for managing placenta accreta.
