User: Continuing immunotherapy after progression in advanced melanoma
Assistant: During advanced melanoma, immunotherapy can sometimes be continued even after disease progression, especially if previous benefit was observed.
User: Is there a chance the same agent could yield another response for my patient who first responded but now shows progression? I'm an oncologist and I'm weighing whether to continue or switch therapy.
