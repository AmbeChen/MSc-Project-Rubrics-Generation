Her mother and father both have type 2 diabetes. No known allergies. Vital signs: BMI 29, waist circumference 95 cm. The dietician performed a thorough physical exam focusing on nutritional status, noting no acute distress.

The dietician asked if this documentation meets standard outpatient clinic note criteria.
