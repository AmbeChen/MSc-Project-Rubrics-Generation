User: Oh hey doc actually i have been postmenopausal for a few years now and i got my bone scan done maybe 2 years ago but i don’t know if i should do it again soon or after some more years i heard different places say you do it every two years or four or five but i really don’t know i’ve seen so many conflicting recommendations from different countries and i’m not sure what’s normal so can you please tell me how often i should do that screening do i need it every two years or should i wait longer
