User: I have a postpartum multiple sclerosis patient. it's about real-world data on postpartum relapse risk, especially how different disease-modifying therapy cessation schedules before and after delivery might influence that risk. also, i'd like any evidence on breastfeeding safety if the mother is on these treatments. can you share your research or references?
