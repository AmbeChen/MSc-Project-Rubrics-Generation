User: What diet is recommended for mild hypertension? I've heard about the DASH approach, do people say it's the best option?
Assistant: The DASH approach is strongly supported by evidence and is often recommended for mild hypertension. It usually includes reducing sodium and increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while focusing on low-fat or nonfat dairy products. Are you interested in guidelines on daily servings, or are you looking for broader meal planning ideas?
User: Yes, I'd like to know how many servings of fruits and vegetables I should aim for each day, and how strict the salt limit is supposed to be.
