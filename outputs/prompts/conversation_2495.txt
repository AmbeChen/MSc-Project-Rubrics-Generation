User: what prophylaxis is recommended for qz-17? it was first identified in malia last month and i want to protect my exposed patient from infection
Assistant: it sounds like you're referring to an emergent virus, qz-17, but i can't find established guidelines. is there any additional background or details on how it spreads, or the patient's risk factors, that might clarify the prophylaxis approach?
User: yes, i'm a physician. the patient is 27, healthy, was definitely exposed to a known qz-17 case. we have no official guidelines, but i'd like any prophylactic measure.
Assistant: understood. i see there's limited data on qz-17. do we have any suspected or confirmed route of transmission, and are you seeking pharmacological or non-pharmacological prophylaxis? i can offer some general suggestions if we have that info.
User: the transmission route is unknown, but the patient had close contact. i'd like both pharmacological and supportive prophylaxis. can you create a single daily plan with recommended medications or measures, even though there's no robust evidence?
