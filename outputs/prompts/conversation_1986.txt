User: I’ve been feeling a bit down for a while, and I think I should talk to a therapist, but I’m completely lost about insurance coverage. My friend said it can be super expensive, so do I check with my insurance first, or do I just pick a random therapist?
Assistant: Therapy costs can vary depending on your insurance plan, and the details can sometimes feel confusing. Generally, it’s good to start by reviewing your plan’s mental health benefits or calling the member services number on your insurance card to see what they cover. They can let you know if you need a specific referral, or if you can pick from their list of in-network therapists to keep costs down. If you choose an out-of-network therapist, you may still get partial coverage or you might have to pay the full fee yourself—it depends on your plan.
User: I see a phone number on my card labeled “Member Services.” Do I just call and ask for a list of people in-network? Or do I search online and then check to see if they’re covered?
Assistant: Either approach can work. If you call, they can walk you through the mental health providers covered under your plan and may even help you schedule an appointment. You could also go to your insurer’s website and look for a “Find a Provider” or “Find a Doctor” tool. There you can filter by mental health or behavioral health specialists in your network. Just make sure to confirm they’re still in-network, because listings can sometimes be outdated.
User: Does that mean I need a referral from my regular doctor, or do I just make an appointment with the therapist directly? I’m so overwhelmed.
