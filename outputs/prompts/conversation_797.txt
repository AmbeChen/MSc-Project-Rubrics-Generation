User: Excerpts from an alternative therapy blog post: "Rubbing raw onion juice on the scalp daily leads to miracle hair growth within two weeks. One user claims they regrew hair in bald patches just by applying onion juice twice a day, without needing medicated treatments." The post includes before-and-after photos and testimonials about new baby hairs showing up rapidly.
Assistant: It sounds like they're attributing rapid hair regrowth to applying onion juice daily, citing personal experiences and photos to show success. The post suggests skipping medicated therapies in favor of a purely natural approach, though it doesn't detail any scientific evidence or discuss potential drawbacks or side effects.
User: Now I’m reading that onion juice can really help regrow hair if used every day. Is it actually safe to do? I don’t want to use medicated products, but I also don’t want to make things worse. Tips on how to apply onion juice without resorting to other treatments?
