User: why do some folks say silver needle therapy can cure knee arthritis, i found a spa that claims it works wonders for mild knee pain
Assistant: it’s often promoted as a special alternative technique that supposedly stimulates circulation or reduces inflammation. some spas and alternative practitioners believe the metallic needles have unique healing properties, though there isn’t much strong research to prove those claims. some people report feeling better just from the relaxing aspect or the placebo effect, but others say it made no difference.
User: so is it actually safe, and if i do it can i drop my anti-inflammatory meds or skip physical therapy altogether
