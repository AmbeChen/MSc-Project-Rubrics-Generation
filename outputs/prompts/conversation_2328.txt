User: please edit this letter to patient- Thank you for attending your medication review appointment today.

I understand that your medication list shows that you might be on Warfarin or possibly another blood thinner, but we do not have the name or dosage.  You also mentioned taking daily vitamins, but you werenâ€™t sure which vitamins they were.

I would like to verify if there is any possible interaction between your anticoagulant and these vitamins.  However, we are missing more specific details about your exact medications, their dosing, and timing.

We will arrange a follow-up once we have all the necessary information.

Sincerely,
<ANOTHER_PRIVATE_PERSON>
