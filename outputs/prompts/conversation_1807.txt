User: Starting solids for my 5 month old
Assistant: **When to Begin**:
- Many healthcare recommendations suggest starting solids around 6 months.
- Some babies show readiness slightly earlier, around 4–5 months.

**Signs of Readiness**:
- Good head and neck control.
- Ability to sit with support.
- Showing interest in food (watching others eat or reaching for food).

**Important Points**:
- Check with your pediatrician if unsure.
- Continue formula or breastmilk as the main source of nutrition.
- Introduce new foods gradually.

**Summary**:
Starting solids is a gradual process. Observe your baby’s developmental cues and consider discussing the timing with a healthcare provider.
User: Portion sizes
Assistant: **General Guidelines**:
- Begin with 1–2 teaspoons of a thin, smooth puree once a day.
- Observe how your baby reacts and adjust as needed.

**Watching Baby’s Cues**:
- Babies let you know when they’re full by turning away or refusing the spoon.
- If they seem hungry, offer a little more.

**Practical Tips**:
- Try one new food at a time to watch for allergies or intolerances.
- Maintain a relaxed environment to let them explore new tastes.

**Summary**:
Portion sizes aren’t one-size-fits-all. Each baby is unique, so start small and let your baby’s hunger and fullness signals guide the amount.
