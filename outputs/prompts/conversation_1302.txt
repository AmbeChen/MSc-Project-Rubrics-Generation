User: i have a boy who was pulled from a pool i want a short rescue and cpr approach so i dont skip steps
Assistant: Hereâ€™s a concise set of steps to consider:

1. **Immediate Rescue**: Remove the child from the water as quickly and safely as possible.
2. **Airway & Breathing**: Check responsiveness, open the airway, and look for breathing. If not breathing, start CPR.
3. **Circulation**: Perform chest compressions if no pulse is palpable or if the heart rate is very slow. Follow pediatric CPR guidelines.
4. **Activate Help**: Call the emergency response team right away and prepare for advanced support.
5. **Post-Resuscitation Care**: Once stable, monitor for signs of respiratory distress or complications.

Any specific points you want more detail on?
