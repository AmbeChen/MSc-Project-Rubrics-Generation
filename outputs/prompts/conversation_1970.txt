User: rewrite this note:

postpartum mother question: "When can I start birth control after giving birth?" no postpartum check details or known complications, no breastfeeding info. recommended start date: 4 weeks postpartum. i'd like to remove the mention of 4 weeks, and i'd add that we do not have enough details about her postpartum status. also please clarify that she should follow up with her ob for any final decision. remove references to postpartum labs or check at 6 weeks, because we don't have that info.
