User: Hey I have a question. I’ve had this dry cough for about three weeks (it started during flu season and I’m really worried it might be pneumonia) I keep thinking maybe this is something serious and I don’t know if I should keep going to work. Is there any way to tell if I’m in real danger? I don’t like it
