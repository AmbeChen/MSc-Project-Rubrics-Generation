User: I had the pleasure of speaking with Jane Doe on July 6. She states she uses Ventolin for mild persistent asthma but also occasionally takes another medication for migraines. She was unsure of the name or dosage of that migraine medication. I would like to confirm whether there are any negative interactions between her inhaler and the unnamed migraine drug, and also see how often she can safely use Ventolin.
