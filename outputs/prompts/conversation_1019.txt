User: my child is 2 years old and not talking yet. i’m worried about her development and want to know what steps or tests might be missing. so far she’s only had routine checkups.
Assistant: A thorough evaluation would normally consider various aspects of the child’s development, but there might not be enough information here to identify missing workup steps conclusively. In many cases, a hearing test or speech therapy referral would be standard; however, without knowing whether your child has undergone hearing assessments or if she has had any formal developmental evaluations, it’s difficult to provide a definite list. Gathering details of previous screenings, family history, the child’s overall health status, and any interventions or observations from early childhood professionals is essential before recommending further tests.
User: organize this into categories and paragraphs that would follow an hpi section of a medical note. keep in the perspective of the mother with “the mother states” (use she/her pronouns, do not use they).
