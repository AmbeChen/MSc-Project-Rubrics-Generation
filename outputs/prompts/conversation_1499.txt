User: I just had a puzzling case.
Assistant: What’s on your mind about it?
User: An older adult with suspected diphtheria, but I’m not seeing the typical pseudomembrane. Also they’re confused, which seems unusual.
Assistant: So there’s a possible atypical presentation, right?
User: Yes, I’d like references to published case reports describing unusual diphtheria presentations in adults and any recommended antibiotic regimens and antitoxin usage.
