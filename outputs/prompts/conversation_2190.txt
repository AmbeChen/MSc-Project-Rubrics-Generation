User: Medication to end pregnancy
Assistant: A medical abortion usually involves prescription medications that vary by country and availability. Before considering this step, it’s important to ensure that the procedure is legal in your region and that you have the appropriate support. Here are some general points:

1. **Legal Status**  
   - Laws governing abortion differ widely, so confirm local regulations. If it’s not legally available, there could be severe legal consequences.
   - Consider consulting a professional who knows relevant laws in your location.

2. **Medical Supervision**  
   - Ideally, these medications require a doctor’s guidance, especially to manage dosage and address potential complications.  
   - In many places, an ultrasound check is recommended to confirm pregnancy duration and rule out ectopic pregnancy.

3. **Typical Approach**  
   - In certain settings, a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is used, but usage protocols can differ by country.
   - Healthcare providers usually advise follow-up appointments to ensure the process is complete and no complications arise.

4. **Safety & Side Effects**  
   - Bleeding and cramping are common. Severe pain, excessively heavy bleeding, or signs of infection need urgent medical care.
   - Without professional monitoring, health risks may be higher.

Because practices vary by region and depend on different approvals, it’s best to consult a trained medical professional to learn about specific options and safe next steps.
