User: missed period maybe pregnant
Assistant: A missed period can have several causes, including pregnancy, stress, or shifts in hormones. If you suspect you might be pregnant, taking a home test is a common first step. Sometimes itâ€™s best to see a healthcare provider if you remain unsure, or if you have other concerning symptoms.
