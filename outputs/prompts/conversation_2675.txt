User: Can you help me draft a SOAP note from my latest patient visit here’s what I have 1) Patient is a 64-year-old male with chronic heart failure who came in for his annual checkup 2) He says he’s been feeling mild fatigue lately but no other new complaints 3) On physical exam we found mild pedal edema but vitals are stable 4) The echocardiogram from last week shows the ejection fraction is still around 45%, so no big changes there 5) My assessment is that his chronic heart failure remains well-managed overall, no acute exacerbations 6) I plan to keep the same medication regimen for now 7) Please put this into a standard SOAP note format
