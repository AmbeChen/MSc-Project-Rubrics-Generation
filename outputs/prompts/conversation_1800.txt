User: edit this: The patient is a 54-year-old female with chronic pancreatitis for the past 5 years. She describes recurrent epigastric pain radiating to her back, often 6/10 in intensity. She has been admitted twice for flare-ups and now takes pancrelipase with meals to help with exocrine insufficiency. She mentions persistent greasy stools and low energy. She has been trying a low-fat diet but the pain is still limiting her daily activities. Physical exam last month showed mild abdominal tenderness. Her BMI has dropped from 22 to 19 since last year, and recent labs revealed low fat-soluble vitamin levels. She wants better pain control and improved nutrition. What is the best management approach to optimize her treatment plan?
