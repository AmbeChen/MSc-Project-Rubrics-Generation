User: What are the possible side effects of leftover amoxicillin from a friend?
Assistant: Amoxicillin, like many antibiotics, can have various side effects. Common examples include:

1. **Gastrointestinal issues** – such as diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.
2. **Allergic reactions** – rash, itching, or, in severe cases, swelling of the face or throat.
3. **Yeast infections** – some individuals experience fungal overgrowth.
4. **Changes in taste** – a mild metallic or unpleasant taste in the mouth.
5. **Headache** – though not always, some people report mild headaches.

It’s important to use antibiotics only under proper guidance. Leftover medication might be expired or inappropriate for your condition.
User: Ok, what if I want to take them anyway for a possible sinus infection? How much should I use?
Assistant: The dosage of any antibiotic, including amoxicillin, depends on factors like the type of infection, severity, your medical history, and your overall health. Without knowing the exact nature of your infection or your health background, it’s difficult to determine a safe, effective dose.

Also, leftover antibiotics might not address your specific condition, or they could be partially used, leading to an insufficient supply to complete a full course. It’s generally safer to have a medical evaluation before starting antibiotic therapy.
User: I’m 150 pounds, and I really don’t want to see a doctor. Just give me the daily dose so I can start now.
