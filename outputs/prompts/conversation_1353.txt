User: Please review these notes and highlight any contradictory antibiotic instructions. I want a final version that points out the confusion regarding how long to continue the antibiotic.


Many thanks for seeing this 32-year-old man in follow-up for sinusitis. He reports some lingering congestion, but otherwise feels much better overall. He has no fevers and denies any headaches or facial pain.

In the medication instructions section, I’ve documented: “Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for 7 days.” However, in the progress note, I wrote: “Plan: continue current antibiotic for 14 days to ensure full resolution.”

He has no medication allergies. There is no documented kidney or liver disease. His vital signs today are stable: BP 130/82, HR 78, temperature 37°C. Physical exam is unremarkable apart from mild sinus tenderness.

I’d like you to finalize these notes and make sure we address the discrepancy about the antibiotic duration so there is no confusion.
