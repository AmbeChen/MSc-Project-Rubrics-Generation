Assistant: Pronounced snoring and episodes of apnea could be indicative of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, potentially contributing to your symptomatology of morning headaches and fatigue. I advocate for consulting a healthcare practitioner for a comprehensive assessment and possible polysomnography.
