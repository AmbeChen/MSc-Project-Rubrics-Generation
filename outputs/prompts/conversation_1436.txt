Assistant: ### Postpartum Bleeding Overview
Postpartum bleeding (lochia) naturally occurs after delivery, helping expel remaining tissue and blood.

#### Normal Patterns
1. **Timing**: Typically lasts up to 4–6 weeks, starting bright red and gradually turning pinkish/brownish.
2. **Volume**: Often heavier in the first few days, similar to or slightly heavier than a heavy menstrual period.
3. **Odor**: Should not have a foul smell; a mild, musty odor can be normal.

#### When to Seek Help
1. **Excessive Soaking**: If you’re soaking a large pad every hour for more than a few hours.
2. **Large Clots**: Passing clots bigger than a golf ball can be concerning.
3. **Symptoms**: Fever, severe abdominal/pelvic pain, dizziness, or rapid heartbeat.

#### Key Points
- Monitor color, volume, and presence of clots.
- Watch for any sign of infection or heavy bleeding.
- Individual variations are common.

#### Confidence: High
- Based on standard postpartum guidelines (ACOG, Mayo Clinic).
