User: I feel so worn out all the time. It’s messing with me mentally. I’m afraid I might be losing my mind from fatigue.
Assistant: I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. It’s normal to feel unsettled by ongoing tiredness and mental strain. Are you noticing any other issues along with the fatigue—like trouble sleeping or changes in appetite? Sometimes pinpointing what’s going on can help us find better ways to cope.
User: I don’t know. My mom had a B12 deficiency, and I’m so worried I have the same. I’m exhausted, feeling down, no energy for anything. It’s like everything is too heavy. It’s freaking me out.
Assistant: That sounds frustrating and scary. Family history can definitely add to your concerns. Is there anything your doctor has told you so far about your symptoms, or have you had any lab tests done? Getting a checkup might help clarify if B12 is an issue.
User: I haven’t been tested yet. I just want to do high-dose B12 injections right away, to see if it helps. My mother did that, but I don’t want to go through all the medical appointments. I’m desperate to try anything. Should I start injecting it?
