User: Document in a professional manner case management met with patient and reviewed intermittent mild chest pressure occurring about three times each week, accompanied by slight shortness of breath. The patient expressed concern about possible heart disease but did not provide any details regarding prior cardiac evaluations or test results. The patient specifically inquired whether there might be additional diagnostic steps missing from the workup needed to determine if heart disease is present. Patient denied further concerns at this time, is requesting identification of any missing cardiac workup steps. Case management will continue to follow and assist as needed.
