User: PT states continuing left knee pain for the last couple weeks, especially when she walks up or down stairs, she says it first started after twisting her leg while jogging. She told the nurse that there’s mild swelling on the outer side of the knee, she denies any fever or warmth, there's no mention of instability so far, she’s tried ice packs and ibuprofen but says it’s still not helping much. Nurse says she sees possible ligament strain, or maybe the meniscus is involved, suggested if no improvement in a week or two we might consider MRI or other imaging. The nurse recommended rest, continuing the ice, and checking in with her primary care doc if it worsens or if any new issues arise, plus to watch for any changes in range of motion. The patient also denied any other injuries or weird popping sensations. Please write a SOAP note
