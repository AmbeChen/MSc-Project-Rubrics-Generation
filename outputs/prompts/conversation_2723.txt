Hi
Just to clarify from the ID specialist:
We have a 45-year-old with type 2 diabetes and newly identified latent TB infection (IGRA positive), negative chest X-ray for active disease, normal baseline LFT, and known rifampin allergy. They want to confirm the best prophylactic medication plan and recommended length of treatment.
