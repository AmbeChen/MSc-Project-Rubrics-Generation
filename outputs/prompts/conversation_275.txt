User: I’m a cardiologist in central Florida, I’m working with a 72-year-old patient who has atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes. He recently had a minor stroke, so now I’m looking to calculate his CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Also, I’ve heard conflicting recommendations about bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin in such cases, and I’m not completely sure about the ideal approach. I want to make sure I’m following current guidelines.
