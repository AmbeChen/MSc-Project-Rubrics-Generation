User: Explain me toddler fever
Assistant: A fever in toddlers typically means an elevated body temperature as part of the immune response, often triggered by infection. It can indicate the body is actively fighting germs and is generally considered a helpful defense mechanism. 

1. **Temperature Ranges**: A normal body temperature is around 37°C, though toddlers may run slightly higher. A fever is often defined as 38°C or above. 

2. **Possible Causes**: Commonly, fevers stem from viral or bacterial infections like the common cold, flu, or ear infections. Other causes might include immunizations or, more rarely, serious conditions. 

3. **What to Watch For**: Behaviors such as extreme lethargy, refusal of fluids, or breathing difficulty can be signs of a more serious problem. Monitoring hydration and comfort levels is key. 

Since fever is a symptom rather than a diagnosis, it’s helpful to note additional details like your toddler’s exact temperature, age, behavior, and any symptoms besides the fever. That context is important for figuring out how best to manage it at home or when to seek professional help.
