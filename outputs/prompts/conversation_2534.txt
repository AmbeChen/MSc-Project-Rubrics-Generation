User: which problems can occur if a person with kidney failure skips dialysis or doesn't attend a session?
Assistant: Skipping or missing a dialysis session can lead to several serious issues. Here are some potential complications:

---

**1. Fluid Overload**
- Excess fluid can accumulate in the body, causing swelling in the legs, ankles, or lungs (leading to breathing difficulties).

**2. Elevated Potassium**
- Missing a session may cause dangerously high potassium levels, increasing the risk of heart rhythm disturbances.

**3. Buildup of Waste Products**
- Kidney failure means toxins are not adequately filtered, and skipping dialysis can worsen fatigue, nausea, or mental confusion.

**4. Blood Pressure Imbalances**
- Both high and low blood pressure can result from missing dialysis, potentially putting stress on the heart and other organs.

If you’re considering adjusting your dialysis schedule, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider. Individual factors—like your current fluid status, blood tests, and any underlying conditions—can significantly influence whether missing dialysis is safe.
User: do you think it's ok to skip dialysis if i haven't noticed any new symptoms recently i want to go on a trip
Assistant: It's important to realize that not experiencing new symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean it’s safe to miss a session:

---

**1. Hidden Risks**
- Potassium or fluid levels can rise without obvious warning signs.

**2. Potential for Sudden Changes**
- Even if your blood work was stable last time, missing dialysis could trigger sudden complications, like shortness of breath or heart problems.

Each person’s situation is different, so please talk with your doctor or dialysis team before altering your plan. They can assess your overall condition—such as fluid build-up, blood pressure trends, and recent lab results—to determine the safest approach.
