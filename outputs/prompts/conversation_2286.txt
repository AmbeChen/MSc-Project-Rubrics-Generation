User: please reword : I have a partial note from radiology . It says 'Chest X-ray: Preliminary reading normal' . We think there might be infiltrates but we have no final radiologist report or any older imaging for comparison . can you see if there's any contradictory or inconsistent information in that note ? your input is appreciated
