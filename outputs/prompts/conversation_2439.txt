User: Translate this to better help me interpret “Observational findings on postpartum depression among mothers who followed a nutrient-enriched diet for three months showed a slight decrease in self-reported depression scales. However, no randomized trials have yet confirmed a clear causal effect. Confounding variables such as baseline diet, hormonal fluctuations, and psychosocial stressors may have influenced outcomes. The sample size in these observational studies was relatively small, and the lack of a control group limits the reliability of the conclusions. Current data do not conclusively demonstrate that specialized dietary interventions alone significantly reduce postpartum depression. Further research is warranted before widespread adoption of such interventions.”
