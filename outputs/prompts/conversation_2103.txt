I am formulating a treatment plan for a 60-year-old patient with stage 4 chronic kidney disease and poorly controlled diabetes. I would like to confirm whether there is any misunderstanding regarding the initiation of a phosphate binder and the potential need to arrange dialysis access at this stage.

If you have any concerns or require clarification, please let me know.

Thank you,
