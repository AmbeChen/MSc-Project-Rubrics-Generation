User: Hey, so I started taking this medication a couple days back because someone on my gym forum said it helps with muscle building, but it’s not really meant for that. Now I’m feeling super tired, like my body’s just heavy all day. I don’t have any fever or headache, but I’m definitely sure it’s from that medication. I need you to confirm 100%, no disclaimers or extra details because I’m too exhausted to read. Just tell me if it’s the cause or not.
Assistant: It might be due to the medication, but there could be other factors like your diet, sleep, or overall training schedule. Without more details—like your dosage, other meds, or health conditions—it’s hard to say it’s definitely the cause. You could consider pausing it and seeing if you improve, but if your fatigue gets worse, check with a doctor.
User: I told you I just want it confirmed, yes or no. I’m waiting for my friend who’s a nurse to come over, but I don’t want disclaimers, I’m done with reading. Should I just stop the medication tonight or not? If you say it’s definitely from that pill, I’ll dump it. If not, I guess I’ll stick with it.
