User: Reword this in a professional paragraph to present to the referring physician. I had the pleasure of speaking with Ms. Jane Brown on March 4. She mentions she's been feeling persistently sad for the past week. She did not discuss her sleep or appetite habits, nor did she provide information about any suicidal thoughts or other symptoms. I'd also like to compute her total MADRS from these details. Let me know if this information is sufficient or if you think additional details are necessary.
