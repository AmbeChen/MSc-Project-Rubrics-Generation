User: Is my postpartum patient’s high blood pressure from stress alone
Assistant: It’s unlikely that postpartum hypertension is caused solely by stress. Elevated blood pressure in the postpartum period can be influenced by multiple factors, such as preeclampsia or existing hypertension. Although stress may contribute, it’s rarely the sole cause.
User: Why is it lower in the clinic but higher at home
Assistant: Blood pressure can fluctuate for various reasons, including anxiety or environment. In the clinic, patients may experience white coat hypertension, but sometimes the opposite occurs if they feel more relaxed there. It’s also possible that different measurement techniques or timing of readings can affect results.
User: No that’s not the case, i used an ambulatory monitor and it’s consistently higher outside the clinic
Assistant: Ah, I see! If those ambulatory readings are accurate, it might suggest a pattern of postpartum hypertension that doesn’t show fully during office visits. We usually look at the overall trend and consider home or ambulatory monitoring to guide therapy decisions. It’s important to confirm the readings and ensure correct use of the monitor.
