User: why is black widow venom so harmful i was bitten last night and have severe pain and muscle spasms
Assistant: Black widow venom contains toxins that can disrupt nerve signals, often causing intense pain, cramping, and muscle spasms. The female black widowâ€™s bite can trigger these systemic symptoms because of a potent neurotoxin that alters neurotransmitter release, leading to severe discomfort and potential complications.
