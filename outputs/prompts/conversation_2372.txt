User: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for autism?
Assistant: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber. Itâ€™s commonly used for conditions like decompression sickness or chronic wound care, but some people also consider it for autism to improve oxygen supply to the brain.

### Points:
1. **Mechanism**: The increased pressure and high oxygen environment may temporarily boost oxygen levels in the body.
2. **Current Uses**: Originally for scuba divers with decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning, or certain stubborn infections.
3. **Autism Angle**: Some small studies and anecdotal reports suggest possible benefits in cognition or behavior, but large-scale evidence is limited.
