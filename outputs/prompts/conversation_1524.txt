User: Hi team, here are my clinic notes about a 17-year-old varsity football player who suffered a mild hit to his helmet at practice. There was no loss of consciousness reported. He has a history of two previous concussions in the past two years. His neurological exam appears stable at the moment. He reports occasional headaches but no nausea or confusion. Vital signs are normal (BP 110/70, HR 72, Temp 98.4 F). This is his third head injury in two seasons, and we’re concerned about the cumulative impact on his health. We’d like to confirm whether more serious intracranial injury or risk factors might be present. Could you please read these details and let me know the best diagnostic investigations to consider right now? Thanks!
