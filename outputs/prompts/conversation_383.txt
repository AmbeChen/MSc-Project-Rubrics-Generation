User: ive been wanting to do a breast self exam how do i check for lumps
Assistant: it’s great that you’re being proactive about your health a self exam can help you get familiar with how your breasts normally look and feel here are some steps you can follow

1 make sure you’re comfortable and have good lighting examine in front of a mirror with your arms at your sides then raise them to see if there’s any visible changes such as dimpling or changes in shape
2 use the pads of your fingers move around your entire breast in a circular motion from the outside to the center check both breasts and the armpit areas for lumps or thickened tissue
3 vary the pressure from light to firm to feel different layers from just beneath the skin down to deeper tissue
4 you can also do this lying down sometimes it’s easier to feel changes when the breast tissue is spread out evenly
5 if you find anything that feels unusual like a hardened knot or thick area take note

would you like more details on the best techniques or positions
User: should i do it at a certain time of the month or does it not matter
