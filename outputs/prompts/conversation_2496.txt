User: my strep test was negative but my throat is still scratchy
Assistant: A negative strep test generally suggests that a bacterial infection is unlikely. A scratchy throat can be caused by many factors, including viral infections, allergies, or even dry air. If you have no other significant symptoms, it might just be a mild irritation that can improve on its own.
User: no fever or allergies
Assistant: With no fever or known allergies, a scratchy throat often indicates a minor irritation or viral cause, especially if itâ€™s the only symptom. It may also be due to environmental factors, like air conditioning or low humidity. Staying hydrated and avoiding irritants such as cigarette smoke can help reduce throat discomfort.
User: would tea, lozenges, or rest help me?
Assistant: Yes, these are typically helpful for mild throat irritation:

1. **Warm liquids like tea**: They can soothe irritation and keep you hydrated. Adding honey might also help coat your throat.
2. **Lozenges**: Throat lozenges or cough drops can offer relief by keeping your throat moist and reducing irritation.
3. **Adequate rest**: Getting enough sleep and taking time to relax helps the body recover.

Monitor your symptoms and consider contacting a healthcare professional if you develop a high fever, significant pain, or if the scratchiness worsens or persists.
