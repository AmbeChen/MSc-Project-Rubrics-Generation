User: I am prescribing prophylactic antibiotics for an immunocompromised 9-year-old patient who is also receiving prophylactic antivirals. I want to ensure we don’t miss any major interactions or contraindications. At this point, I’d like to write bullet points with one-sentence informative descriptions. Here are the bullet points:
1. Potential Interactions
2. Additional Monitoring
3. Recommended Adjustments
Assistant: Here are the bullet points with one-sentence informative descriptions:

1. **Potential Interactions:** Check for any overlapping metabolic pathways or enzyme competition that might heighten toxicity.
2. **Additional Monitoring:** Incorporate regular lab tests to track kidney and liver function while on combined prophylaxis.
3. **Recommended Adjustments:** Tailor medication dosages or timing to minimize interactions and maximize therapeutic benefit.
User: Redo the Potential Interactions part. Provide me 5 different variations
