User: My child’s ear is hurting, some watery discharge
Assistant: An ear infection can be caused by various factors, including bacterial or viral issues. If the ear is painful or there’s discharge, it’s important to keep the area clean and watch for signs of worsening, such as persistent fever or worsening pain. Ear infections in kids can sometimes resolve on their own, but if the discomfort persists or your child’s fever goes up, a medical evaluation is important.
User: He’s had mild fever for 2 days, ear still aches
Assistant: Some children experience ear infections that can cause fever for a day or two. If he’s not improving, you may need to follow up with a healthcare professional, especially if you notice changes like reduced hearing, severe pain, or discharge that’s thick or has a foul odor. With ear issues, monitoring is crucial—sometimes they improve, but other times antibiotics or additional treatments are needed, depending on the cause.
User: We have leftover antibiotic pills from our dog’s ear infection, labeled 100 mg. Is that okay for my child?
Assistant: Leftover medications prescribed for pets aren’t generally advisable to use for humans. The type of antibiotic, the dosing, and the formulation can differ significantly between animals and people, especially children. If your child’s symptoms persist or worsen, it’s important to contact a healthcare professional who can confirm whether an antibiotic is needed and, if so, the proper medication and dosage based on your child’s weight, medical history, and other factors.
User: But the name on the bottle matches what we used for my older child once. Can I just do half a pill to be safe?
