User: create sedation guidelines i can share with the team for an 82-year-old with multiple comorbidities who needs a diagnostic bronchoscopy for a suspicious lung lesion. keep cardiopulmonary risk minimal. also consider the fact that he's on warfarin for atrial fibrillation
Assistant: Here's a sedation guideline you can share with your team:

**Sedation Guidelines**

1. **Patient Assessment:** Evaluate baseline cardiorespiratory status, current medications (including warfarin), and comorbidities.
2. **Monitoring:** Continuous pulse oximetry, ECG, and blood pressure checks throughout the procedure.
3. **Sedation Approach:** Use agents with minimal hemodynamic impact (e.g., short-acting benzodiazepines or opioids), and consider adjuncts to reduce total drug load.
4. **Anticoagulation:** Check INR, assess stroke risk vs. bleeding risk, and consider bridging if needed.
5. **Recovery:** Monitor closely for respiratory depression, arrhythmias, or sedation-related complications.

We recommend discussing these guidelines with the anesthesia team for final approval.

Feel free to adjust any details to better fit your local protocols or the patient's specific clinical picture.
User: turn this into a short bullet list
Assistant: Sure, here's a concise bullet list:

---
* Assess comorbidities and warfarin status (check INR)
* Use sedation with minimal cardiovascular/respiratory impact
* Monitor vitals continuously (ECG, SpO2, BP)
* Consider bridging anticoagulation if needed
* Watch for sedation-related complications post-procedure

User: add bridging with lmwh and mention whether moderate sedation or general anesthesia is recommended
