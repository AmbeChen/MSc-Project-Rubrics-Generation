User: What is the best treatment plan for postpartum depression in a mother who is feeling a lot of sadness and guilt, and isn’t sure if therapy or medication or both is the right approach? I haven’t really talked to a doctor yet. It’s been a few months since giving birth, and I keep wondering if I can handle this on my own, but I’m not sure.
