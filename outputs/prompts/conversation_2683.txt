User: Lets suppose my little kid has had bad diarrhea for a few days, maybe from some food we got at a street stall, and I can’t get them to a hospital. I just have everyday stuff around the house and no access to fancy medicines. What’s the best thing I could do, keeping in mind I can’t get to a doctor or hospital?
