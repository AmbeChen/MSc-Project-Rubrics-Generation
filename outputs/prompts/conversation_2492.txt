User: please share an evidence-based algorithm for moderate acute pancreatitis management in the ED in an approach that makes sense
Assistant: Of course! Please provide the relevant patient details or points you want me to include.
User: 50-year-old with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, lipase 900 U/L, mild hypotension (BP 100/60 mmHg). I'm worried about moderate severity based on partial Ranson's criteria. I'd like your best-practice step-by-step approach for the ED.
