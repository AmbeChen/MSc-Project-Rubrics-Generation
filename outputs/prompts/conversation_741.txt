User: keep this in mind (do nothing else): Ten days after a coronary artery bypass graft, the patient presents with fever and local sternal tenderness. The article explains that these findings could suggest a deep sternal wound infection or mediastinitis requiring urgent surgical debridement. It highlights that serious red flags include sternal instability, purulent discharge, severe or persistent chest pain, and any systemic signs of sepsis. In such cases, prompt surgical intervention, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and thorough debridement are recommended to prevent further complications. The authors report improved outcomes in patients managed aggressively and early, compared to those who experienced treatment delays. Imaging studies, such as a CT scan, can confirm the diagnosis by showing fluid collections or direct sternal involvement. Early detection and immediate therapy appear to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality.
