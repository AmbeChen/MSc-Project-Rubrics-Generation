User: does wearing a mask actually help keep me from getting colds or flu? i see people wearing them in random places and i get confused
Assistant: yes, wearing a mask can help reduce the spread of airborne infections, like colds or flu. it’s generally recommended in many public health guidelines, especially in crowded indoor spaces.
User: so do i need to wear one in the grocery store or coffee shop? or is it mostly if i’m sick
Assistant: it’s commonly suggested to wear a mask when you’re indoors around others, particularly if you can’t maintain distance. if you’re sick, it’s especially considerate to wear one to protect those around you. many people also wear masks in public settings as a precaution.
User: i also go to the park a lot. do i need a mask outside? i just want to do everything i can to avoid colds or flu
