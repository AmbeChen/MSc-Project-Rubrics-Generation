The patient (BZ, age 28) wrote: "I started Adderall XR 15 mg daily last week (switched from 10 mg). I'm noticing trouble sleeping, a racing heartbeat, and a total drop in focus by the afternoon. My prescriber told me to check in after a week at this higher dose. I really think I might need to switch medication or go back down. It's messing with my daily activities."

Additional context: BZ logs that the side effects began right after increasing the dosage. The original reason for the dose increase was to address midday slump in focus. The prescriber said to weigh benefits vs side effects and then consider an alternative or reduce the dose if needed.

My question: What does the above note from the patient indicate? Can you compose a MyChart message responding to their concerns about a possible dose adjustment or an alternative medication?
