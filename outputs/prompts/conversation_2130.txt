User: Which medication is more likely to help me sleep better, Trazodone or Zolpidem? I can’t get any rest these days.
Assistant: Both Trazodone (an antidepressant used off-label for insomnia) and Zolpidem (a sedative-hypnotic) can help promote sleep, but they work differently.

- **Trazodone**: Often used for insomnia due to its sedating side effects, though it may cause grogginess the next day.
- **Zolpidem**: Specifically approved for short-term treatment of insomnia, can be habit-forming if used long-term.

If you’re struggling with persistent insomnia, it’s a good idea to discuss your situation with a doctor, especially to consider potential underlying causes and the best treatment approach.
User: Is the reason I can’t sleep that I’m depressed, or could it be something else? Should I just get a prescription to fix it permanently?
