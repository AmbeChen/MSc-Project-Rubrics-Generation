User: I am an obstetrician-gynecologist, I read some postpartum exercise programs claim to drastically reduce future risk of pelvic organ prolapse
Assistant: Small preliminary studies do suggest pelvic floor strengthening regimens might offer benefits for postpartum patients, but data is limited. Larger, well-controlled trials are lacking, so it's not yet clear how much these exercises reduce long-term prolapse risk.
User: I saw a pilot study claiming a 60% reduction in prolapse rates at 1 year postpartum, which sounds huge
Assistant: Pilot studies can provide interesting insights, but they often have small sample sizes and may not represent the broader population. Without larger, more definitive research, itâ€™s difficult to conclusively say these exercises achieve that magnitude of reduction.
User: So do we actually have robust evidence, or is it speculation? I want definitive guidance before recommending it widely
