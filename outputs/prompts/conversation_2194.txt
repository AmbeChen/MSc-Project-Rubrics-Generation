User: IMPRESSION:

6-year-old with suspected tethered cord, repeatedly unable to remain still during MRI attempts. One session with mild sedation was tried but caused side effects. An alternative trial involved creating a calm environment with soft music and quiet play, and the child tolerated about half the scan.

â€“We want to determine if sedation-assisted MRI is appropriate for the remainder of imaging or if we should continue with repeated child-friendly measures to get a full scan.

Which approach is recommended next?
