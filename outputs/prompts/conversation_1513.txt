User: Kindly evaluate a 45 year old male with complaints of neck stiffness each morning for 2 weeks. Sometimes he experiences a mild headache on waking but denies fever, chills, or photophobia. Vitals are stable (pulse 78/min, bp 120/80 mmhg), no significant past injuries mentioned, and basic labs are not available yet. Heâ€™s worried about a serious issue like a pinched nerve or meningitis. Kindly advise.
