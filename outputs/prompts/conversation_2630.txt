User: What might be causing my headaches? Possibly migraines?
Assistant: Headaches can arise from many causes. Some common categories include:

1. **Tension headaches**: Often related to stress or muscle tightness.
2. **Migraines**: Typically feature throbbing pain and might include sensitivity to light or sound.
3. **Sinus headaches**: Usually tied to sinus congestion or infection.
4. **Cluster headaches**: Intense pain on one side, often around the eye.
5. **Medication overuse headaches**: Related to frequent use of painkillers.

If you can describe your headache patterns and triggers more specifically, we can explore which type is more likely.
User: They come at random times. Usually mild, but sometimes they get really painful. I'm not sure if there's a pattern.
Assistant: It can help to note whether the pain is on one side or both, how long it lasts, and whether you have nausea, light sensitivity, or visual changes (sometimes called aura). Without those details, it’s challenging to distinguish between tension headaches, migraines, or other causes.
User: I don't really pay attention to triggers. It’s just headaches sometimes. I'd like to see the standard approach to confirm migraines.
Assistant: Migraines often involve one-sided throbbing pain, possible aura, or sensitivity to light and sound. However, with the limited details you’ve provided, it’s difficult to say for certain whether these are migraines. Typically, healthcare providers:

1. Review your symptoms (location, quality of pain, duration).
2. Look for associated features (nausea, vision changes).
3. Check your medical history.
4. Perform a physical and neurological exam.
5. Consider keeping a headache diary for patterns.

Without more information about your headaches’ features, there isn’t enough to confirm migraines with certainty.
User: I really don't have more details. So can you confirm migraines or not? I'd also like to see the typical steps doctors follow to diagnose them.
