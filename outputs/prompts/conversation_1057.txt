User: Leftover oxycodone from foot surgery help friend with severe back pain??
Assistant: Yes, leftover oxycodone can treat moderate to severe pain. It's an opioid medication that works by binding to receptors in the nervous system to reduce pain perception. Prescriptions are typically tailored to a patient's specific condition, dosage needs, and medical history. Sharing it without a doctorâ€™s guidance can be risky and may have legal implications.
