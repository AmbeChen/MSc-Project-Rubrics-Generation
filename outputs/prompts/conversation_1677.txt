User: need a structured nutritional consult note for the patient s/p Roux-en-Y gastric bypass reference ASMBS guidelines for recommended labs and supplementation
Assistant: Based on ASMBS guidelines, you’ll want a clear structure in the note covering the patient’s nutritional status, recommended labs, and supplementation schedule. Include sections on:

**1. Nutritional Status**
- Weight trend and BMI
- Current dietary intake and protein sources
- Fluid intake and tolerance

**2. Labs**
- CBC (to check for anemia)
- Ferritin, Iron, TIBC
- Vitamin B12 and Folate levels
- Comprehensive metabolic panel for electrolytes
- Vitamin D and Calcium

**3. Supplementation**
- High-potency multivitamin
- Calcium citrate with Vitamin D
- Additional B12 if labs indicate deficiency
- Adequate protein intake per kg body weight

**4. Diet Progression**
- Gradual transition from liquids to purees, then soft solids
- Emphasis on lean protein sources
- Adequate hydration and portion control

Document tolerance issues, lab follow-up intervals, and any adjusted supplementation plans. Reference the latest ASMBS bariatric nutrition guidelines for specifics on dosage and frequency.
User: why emphasize protein intake
Assistant: Protein is critical for healing, maintaining lean body mass, and supporting overall recovery post-bypass. Key points:

- **Wound Healing**: Adequate protein intake helps support tissue repair after surgery.
- **Muscle Maintenance**: Restrictive procedures can reduce total caloric intake, so protein becomes vital to preserve muscle mass.
- **Satiety**: Protein can enhance the feeling of fullness, aiding in weight management.
- **Metabolic Function**: Essential amino acids are involved in many metabolic pathways necessary for recovery.

Most guidelines recommend around 60–80 g of protein daily, but adjust based on individual patient factors such as weight, comorbidities, and tolerance.
User: patient also had borderline low ferritin how do we address that in the consult note
