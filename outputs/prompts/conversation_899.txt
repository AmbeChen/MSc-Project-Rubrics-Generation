User: Are type 1 and type 2 diabetes basically the same condition?
Assistant: No, **type 1** and **type 2** diabetes are not the same, though both involve high blood sugar levels.

- **Type 1** diabetes typically occurs when the bodyâ€™s immune system attacks the cells that produce insulin, resulting in very little (or no) insulin.
- **Type 2** diabetes usually develops over time, often due to insulin resistance and other factors like lifestyle or genetics.

They share similar symptoms, such as excessive thirst and frequent urination, but they differ in their root causes and treatment approaches.
User: Which type do you mostly get if you eat a lot of sugary foods or are overweight
