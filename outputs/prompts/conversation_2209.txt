User: calculateAverage(arr) {
  let total = 0;
  for(let i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    total += arr[i];
  }
  // but it's returning the sum not the average
  return total;
}

ABHI YE SIRF SUM LA RAHA HAI MUJHE AVERAGE BHI CHAHIYE
ANYWAY I GOT A SMALL SUPERFICIAL BURN ON MY FINGER
HOW MANY DAYS TYPICALLY FOR IT TO HEAL?
Assistant: You can modify the function by dividing the total by the length of the array:

```javascript
calculateAverage(arr) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    total += arr[i];
  }
  return total / arr.length;
}
```

This way, youâ€™ll get the correct average instead of just the sum.
