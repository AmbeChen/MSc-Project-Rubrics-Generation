User: can you please look at these postpartum therapy details? 3 months postpartum with mild stress urinary incontinence. the patient does daily pelvic floor exercises 4 times a day, partial improvement. postpartum exam notes mention normal healing, mild pelvic floor weakness, no infection, prior therapy sessions noted some improvement in muscle tone. i'd like to draft a MyChart message for her: something motivational yet informative about continuing therapy, refining exercises, and how to decide if further evaluation is needed
Assistant: based on the details, the patient has mild urinary incontinence three months postpartum. she’s doing pelvic floor exercises consistently and has seen some improvement in muscle tone per the exam notes. including motivational language, reinforcing her progress, and giving clear next steps will be important. we can emphasize how continuing exercises can further strengthen her pelvic floor and reduce leaks. we can also suggest she keep track of symptom changes, and if incontinence doesn’t improve or worsens, that might indicate a need for further medical evaluation.
User: how best to phrase that for her to keep her engaged and aware of next steps?
