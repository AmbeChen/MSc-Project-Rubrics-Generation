User: Can you confirm the best approach to phenytoin dosing in advanced hepatic failure?
Assistant: Sure! Please provide any details you'd like me to consider.
User: Ok friends, is it what's on the inside that counts or the outside that counts? :) In this case, it's the liver! We have a patient with advanced hepatic failure, albumin of 2.1 g/dL, total bilirubin 6 mg/dL, and they're currently on 300 mg of phenytoin daily. Lately they've shown sedation, ataxia, and mild nystagmus, so I'm worried about phenytoin toxicity. I'd like to reduce the dose to 200 mg daily or maybe 100 mg BID. Should I measure free levels? I'd love references on the standard approach for hepatic impairment. Let me know.
