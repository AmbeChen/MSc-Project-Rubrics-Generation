User: which cpt code do we use for a palliative care consult the note says: “introduced palliative measures recommended follow-up in a month no mention of patient condition or complexity no time documented”
Assistant: Typically, choosing a CPT code for a palliative care consultation depends on factors like time spent, complexity of decision-making, and the extent of discussion about goals of care. If the note doesn’t specify these details (e.g., whether it was a brief or extended discussion), you may need to verify the session’s length and complexity. In many cases, you can use an Evaluation and Management (E/M) code or an advanced care planning code (99497, 99498) if it involves counseling and decision-making. Without more specifics, it’s difficult to confirm the code.
User: make sure it’s set up for coding the doc states: “we had a consult stable not many details but we want a code for this session next step is advanced planning the patient might consider hospice eventually” i’d like the final code for billing
