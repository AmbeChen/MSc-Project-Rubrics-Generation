User: Hey so for like the past couple of weeks I'm having this dryness on my cheeks, I'm washing my face with a regular mild soap, not super hot water or anything, but it still feels kinda tight and flaky. I've never had it like this before but I'm guessing I should maybe apply more moisturizer or something. Is there something else I'm missing, I'm a bit unsure.
