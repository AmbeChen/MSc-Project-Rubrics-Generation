User: I gave birth two weeks ago, and my breasts are really engorged and painful. I’m 25, there’s no fever or infection, and I’ve been using some cool compresses. Not sure how often I should pump or if I should just nurse more. My baby’s latching fine, but this is getting really uncomfortable. Are there best practices for relieving engorgement?
Assistant: Breast engorgement can be quite common a couple of weeks postpartum. Here’s a quick rundown:

- **Frequent feeding or pumping**: Removing milk regularly can help reduce pressure. If you’re nursing, aim to feed on demand, and if you pump, keep sessions moderate in length.
- **Cool or warm compresses**: Cool packs can help relieve swelling and pain, while a warm compress before feeding can aid let-down.
- **Supportive bra**: A well-fitting, supportive (but not overly tight) bra can help with discomfort.
- **Gentle massage**: Lightly massaging breasts can improve milk flow and ease engorgement.

Because there’s no fever or infection, these steps might provide relief. If pain persists or gets worse, contact a healthcare provider.
User: I’m also worried about pumping too much and making the problem worse. Any other suggestions for managing or reducing the pain?
