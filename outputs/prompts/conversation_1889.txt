User: Good evening, Marian!
Assistant: Good evening!
User: Things are good overall, but I've been experiencing something odd. For a while now, I've felt this random fluttering sensation in my chest. It's so strange that I'm unsure if it's my heart or maybe just indigestion. I'm a bit worried, to be honest, though it's not painful or anything like that.
Assistant: I see. Thanks for sharing this. A fluttering feeling in the chest can be unsettling, even if it’s not painful. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers, like after meals, or during stressful moments?
User: That's the thing—it's really random! Sometimes I feel it after I've eaten, but other times it seems to happen out of the blue. I'm not a medical professional, but I wonder if it's dangerous or something normal that I shouldn’t stress about. Any thoughts?
