User: We have a 55-year-old female patient diagnosed with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis for 8 years. She has had partial response to methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide. Her ESR is 32 and CRP is 15. Her rheumatologist is recommending starting a TNF inhibitor to better control her symptoms and prevent further joint damage. Create a single-paragraph prior authorization request that summarizes her condition, prior treatments, lab findings, and the medical necessity for this biologic.
Assistant: Below is a single-paragraph prior authorization request:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with an 8-year history of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, characterized by elevated inflammatory markers (ESR 32, CRP 15). Despite trials of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide, she continues to experience joint pain and inflammation, indicating partial therapeutic response. A TNF inhibitor is necessary to achieve better disease control, reduce progression of joint damage, and improve her overall quality of life, making this biologic therapy a medically appropriate next step.
User: Organize it into clearly labeled sections for Diagnosis, Labs, Prior Treatments, and Rationale. Use the perspective of the patient, for example, “The patient states...” or “The patient reports...”. Keep pronouns as she/her, and do not use they.
