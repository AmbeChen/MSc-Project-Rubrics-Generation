User: Creating a standardized daily flowsheet for neurological exams for my stroke patients. I'm a neurology resident. I'd like to record MRC scale for muscle strength, reflexes, sensation, and cranial nerves. I typically note Brunnstrom stages, pupillary responses, etc.
Assistant: A standardized daily flowsheet often includes key motor and sensory findings, along with cranial nerve assessments. For post-stroke patients, you’d typically track motor function with the MRC scale (0–5) for each major muscle group, note reflexes using the 0–4+ deep tendon grading, and document sensory changes in terms of light touch or pinprick deficits.

Cranial nerve assessments could list each nerve: for example, CN II (visual fields, acuity), CN III/IV/VI (eye movements, pupillary responses), CN VII (facial symmetry), and so on. It might also include Brunnstrom staging details if you regularly follow motor recovery patterns. This allows you to quickly identify any changes in neurological status from day to day.
User: Should we detail each cranial nerve, or just highlight key deficits for quick daily rounding
Assistant: It’s common to highlight only the key deficits during daily rounding—for example, focusing on pupils (size, reactivity), extraocular movements, facial symmetry, swallow/gag reflex, and any new or evolving deficits. However, in a teaching environment, some prefer to note each cranial nerve systematically, especially for neurology inpatients, to ensure nothing gets overlooked.

If time is limited, you can prioritize changes or relevant abnormalities (e.g., new diplopia, facial droop, or pupillary asymmetry). If your rounds are more extensive or for documentation in a teaching hospital, enumerating each nerve exam can reinforce thoroughness and training for the team.
User: Go ahead and compile everything into a single standardized flowsheet for daily rounding
