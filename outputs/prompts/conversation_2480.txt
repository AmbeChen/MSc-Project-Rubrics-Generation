This is a 28-year-old man, Mark Walters, who has been managing Type 1 Diabetes with multiple daily injections for over a decade. He is seeking better glycemic control and consistent insulin delivery through an insulin pump. 

Write this in a better understandable way as a formal referral letter to an endocrinologist for possible insulin pump therapy
