Assistant: Yes, high-speed collisions can potentially cause serious neck injuries, ranging from whiplash to spinal cord damage. Here’s a quick overview:

### 1. **Neck Strain and Whiplash**
- Sudden impact can force the neck to snap forward and back, straining muscles and ligaments.
- Pain can be immediate or worsen over hours or days.

### 2. **Potential Spinal Injuries**
- Severe collisions may cause vertebral fractures or damage to spinal discs.
- This can lead to numbness, weakness, or reduced range of motion.

### 3. **Neurological Concerns**
- If nerves are pinched or damaged, symptoms might include tingling or loss of sensation.
- Early medical evaluation is crucial to rule out serious complications.

### How to Address Next Steps
- Monitor for intensifying pain or new symptoms.
- Consider seeking professional care to check for any structural or nerve issues.
- Rest and ice might help with minor neck soreness, but persistent or severe pain could signal something more serious.

If you notice any alarming symptoms like difficulty moving limbs, loss of feeling, or severe dizziness, it’s especially important to get immediate medical attention.
