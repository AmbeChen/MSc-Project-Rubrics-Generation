User: I have a rash on my forearm that keeps appearing and disappearing, no idea why
It's mostly red but I'm scared it could be something serious
Assistant: It sounds like you’re dealing with a recurring rash on your forearm, which can have several causes, including:

1. **Allergic or Irritant Contact Dermatitis**: Can happen if something is repeatedly touching your skin.
2. **Eczema or Atopic Dermatitis**: Often triggered by irritants, stress, or dry conditions.
3. **Fungal Infection**: Less common but can present as red, patchy areas.
4. **Autoimmune or Other Skin Conditions**: Possible but would typically have other hallmark symptoms.

### Immediate Steps:
- Monitor the rash closely: Does it itch or burn? Does it spread or change color?
- Keep the area clean, and avoid harsh soaps.
- If you notice increasing pain, swelling, or signs of infection (like pus), **consider seeking urgent medical evaluation**.

How long have you been noticing these flare-ups, and does anything seem to trigger it?
