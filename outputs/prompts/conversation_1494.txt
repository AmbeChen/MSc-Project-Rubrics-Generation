User: Meaning of mild fever in 16 year old
Assistant: For a 16-year-old, a mild fever generally signals your body is working to fight off an infection or manage a slight immune response. It can come from things like the common cold, flu, or even mild infections in the throat or sinuses.

Usually, fevers help your body deal with germs, and a mild one can last a couple of days. But if it gets higher, sticks around longer, or comes with more serious symptoms—like trouble breathing or severe weakness—then it might be worth checking in with a healthcare professional.
User: I have chills and a runny nose for 2 days is it serious or just a normal cold
Assistant: Chills and a runny nose over a couple of days are common signs of a viral infection, such as the flu or a mild respiratory bug. They can make you feel run-down or tired, but many people recover with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medication for comfort.

It helps to keep an eye out for changes: if your fever goes up a lot, you develop chest pain or find it tough to breathe, or you start feeling worse rather than better, it’s good to talk to a healthcare provider. Otherwise, it might just be a passing illness.
