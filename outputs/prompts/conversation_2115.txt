User: which code is correct for postpartum depression f53.0 or f53.1 i am an ob-gyn
Assistant: postpartum depression can be classified under postpartum mood disturbances but the specific code may depend on the severity and whether psychotic features are present here are some points:

1. **f53.0** typically includes mild to moderate postpartum mental and behavioral disorders
2. **f53.1** might be used if there are severe or psychotic symptoms
3. the icd-10 also mentions looking at duration and level of impairment

if your patient shows depressive symptoms without psychotic features you might consider f53.0 but you should review official icd-10 guidelines and your clinical documentation
User: explain the guidelines so i can code postpartum depression properly
