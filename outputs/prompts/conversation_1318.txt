User: Please help me finalize this short ward note below and advise if we can calculate the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS).


Many thanks for seeing this 70-year-old gentleman who was found drowsy on the ward. I understand the nurse only documented that he is “more drowsy than usual”.  She has not documented his heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, or temperature.  There is no mention of any new medications.  No known allergies.

He remains clinically stable.  He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.  No recent swelling is noted.  His wife is present, and she does not report anything unusual apart from his drowsiness.  He is a non-smoker.

Observations: The nurse is planning to measure his vital signs shortly.
Examination: The nurse writes, “Patient is drowsy, but no additional details available.”

I would greatly appreciate a MEWS or sedation scale rating for this patient, based on the note above.
