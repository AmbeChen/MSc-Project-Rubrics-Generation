User: I have a two-week-old baby whose breathing seems to be short shallow gasps, then suddenly there are long pauses. She also looks pale around the lips and doesn’t really respond when I try to feed her. She’s so lethargic that it’s scaring me. I want you to act as a pediatric practitioner and tell me what could be wrong, if I need to see the doctor, and what kind of doctor.
