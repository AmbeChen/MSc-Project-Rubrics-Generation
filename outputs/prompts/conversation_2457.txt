User: What do you think of this mental health check-in note: 'Patient doing somewhat better, no changes.'
Assistant: That note suggests the patient had only a slight improvement or stability, with no updates to medication or treatment. It doesn’t provide much detail on the patient’s overall status or care plan.
User: Could you write a thorough summary for the patient so they understand their outpatient visit? The only info we have is that note: 'Patient doing somewhat better, no changes.'
