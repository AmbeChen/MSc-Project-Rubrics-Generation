Hello <SCHOOL_NURSE>,

We're planning an updated immunization schedule for children in 2024. We want to confirm that a new mandatory booster for 2-year-olds is included. Let me know if there's any official documentation available yet.

Thank you,

User: i'm trying to find the official guidelines for the 2024 immunization schedule. where are they published?
Assistant: Official immunization schedules in many countries are typically published by health agencies (like the CDC in the United States) on their websites. If you don’t see the 2024 schedule posted there yet, it may not have been released publicly. You can also check for announcements in medical journals or provider bulletins.

If you have a local or regional health authority, try their website or reach out to them for more details. Sometimes, new schedules are announced in press releases or conference briefings before the full documentation is published.
User: someone said the new booster for 2-year-olds was confirmed and announced last week. please give me the official date it was published and link me to the final guidance documents.
