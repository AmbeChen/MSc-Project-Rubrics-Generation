Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complicated disorder.
It causes extreme fatigue that lasts for at least six months. Symptoms worsen with physical or mental activity but don't fully improve with rest.
The cause of ME/CFS is unknown, although there are many theories. Experts believe it might be triggered by a combination of factors.
 There's no single test to confirm a diagnosis. You may need a variety of medical tests to rule out other health problems that have similar symptoms. Treatment for the condition focuses on easing symptoms.
Symptoms of ME/CFS can vary from person to person, and the severity of symptoms can fluctuate from day to day. In addition to fatigue, symptoms may include:
Some people with this condition have headaches, sore throats, and tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpits. People with the condition also may become extra sensitive to light, sound, smells, food and medicines.
Fatigue can be a symptom of many illnesses. In general, see your doctor if you have persistent or excessive fatigue.
