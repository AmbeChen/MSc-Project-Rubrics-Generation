Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a health issue that becomes more common with age. It's also called an enlarged prostate. The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen. It's found just below the bladder. And it often gets bigger as you get older.
An enlarged prostate can cause symptoms that may bother you, such as blocking the flow of urine out of the bladder. It also can cause bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems.
Many treatments can help BPH. These include medicines, surgery and other procedures. Your health care provider can help you choose. The right option depends on things such as:
The symptoms of BPH tend to slowly get worse. But sometimes they stay the same or even improve over time.
The size of the prostate doesn't always determine how serious the symptoms are. Some people with slightly enlarged prostates can have major symptoms. Others who have very enlarged prostates can have minor problems. And some people with enlarged prostates don't have any symptoms at all.
Some other health problems can lead to symptoms that are like those caused by enlarged prostate. These include:
Some medicines also may lead to symptoms that seem like those caused by BPH. These include: 
Talk to your health care provider about your symptoms, even if they don't bother you. It's important to find out if there are any causes that could be treated. Without treatment, the risk of a dangerous blockage of the urinary tract can rise.
If you can't pass any urine, get medical help right away.

Usually, the prostate gland is about the size and shape of a walnut or golf ball. When enlarged, the prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
Usually, the prostate gland is about the size and shape of a walnut or golf ball. When enlarged, the prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
The prostate gland is located beneath the bladder. The tube that moves urine from the bladder out of the penis is called the urethra. This tube passes through the center of the prostate. When the prostate gets bigger, it starts to block urine flow.
The prostate is a gland that typically keeps growing throughout life. This growth often enlarges the prostate enough to cause symptoms or to block urine flow.
It isn't clear what causes the prostate to get bigger. It might be due to changes in the balance of sex hormones as you grow older.
Risk factors for an enlarged prostate include:
Complications of an enlarged prostate can include:
Treatment for BPH lowers the risk of these complications. But urinary retention and kidney damage can be serious health threats.
Having an enlarged prostate is not thought to raise the risk of getting prostate cancer.
