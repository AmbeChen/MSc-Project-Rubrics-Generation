An AED may save your life during cardiac arrest. Weigh the pros and cons to see if you should get one.
An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a portable device that can be used to treat a person whose heart has suddenly stopped working. This condition is called sudden cardiac arrest.
AEDs are available in many public places, such as government buildings, schools, airports and other community spaces. Small, lightweight AEDs are available without a prescription for use at home.
People with severe heart disease who are at risk of sudden cardiac arrest might consider having an AED at home. Talk to your healthcare professional about whether you should buy an AED for your home.
An AED is used to revive someone from sudden cardiac arrest. This usually happens when a problem in the heart's electrical activity causes a dangerously irregular heartbeat. The irregular heartbeat prevents the heart from pumping as it should and causes the heart to stop.
When this happens, the brain and other organs don't get the blood and oxygen they need. Treatment is needed within minutes to prevent death. The sooner the heartbeat is restored, the greater the chance there won't be permanent damage to the brain and other organs.
All AEDs include instructions on when and how to use them. Training on proper use of an AED is recommended. But someone with no training also can use the device to reset the heartbeat of a person who has had a sudden cardiac arrest. Using the AED could possibly save a life.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after cardiac arrest can keep blood flowing to the heart and brain for a time. But often only defibrillation can restore the heartbeat. Together these treatments can improve the chances of survival.

Supporters of home AEDs say putting them where they're needed most will save many lives. But critics argue there's not enough evidence to show that home AEDs save more lives.
