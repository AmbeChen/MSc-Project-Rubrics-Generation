Deferasirox is used to remove excess iron from the body in patients who have had too many blood transfusions and in patients with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia syndromes. 
Deferasirox is an iron chelator (binder). It combines with iron in the blood. The combination of iron and deferasirox is then removed from the body by the kidneys. If you have too much iron in the body, it can damage various organs and tissues.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of deferasirox in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children with transfusional iron overload who are younger than 2 years of age, or in children with chronic iron overload and non-transfusional-dependent thalassemia who are younger than 10 years of age. 
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of deferasirox in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving deferasirox.
