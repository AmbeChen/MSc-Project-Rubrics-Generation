Despite many studies, it isn't clear whether cinnamon helps lower blood sugar in people with diabetes. Some studies of cinnamon have shown a benefit. Others haven't.
Many of those research studies included different doses and different types of cinnamon. That makes it hard to compare the results. It's possible that cinnamon might help the body use insulin more efficiently. But more research is needed to determine if, and how, cinnamon supplements might help people with diabetes.
For most people, cinnamon supplements seem to be safe, at least in small amounts for short-term use. But higher amounts used for longer periods of time may trigger side effects such as gastrointestinal problems or allergic reactions. It also may cause problems for people who have liver disease. Talk to your health care provider before taking any supplements. Together, you and your provider can make sure the supplements are safe for you, and that they won't affect any medicine you're already taking.
It's also important to remember that no single supplement alone can treat diabetes. Diabetes management includes healthy eating, regular exercise, blood sugar monitoring, and sometimes, diabetes medications or insulin therapy.
