Indigestion is discomfort or pain in the belly. Symptoms may include a burning pain, feeling full while eating or feeling full long after eating. Indigestion symptoms may happen once in a while or often.
Indigestion may be caused by a digestive system condition. But often, there is no clear underlying cause. Frequent or long-lasting indigestion often can be treated with changes in diet and lifestyle, mental health therapy, and medicines.
Indigestion also is called upset stomach or dyspepsia.
Sometimes people with indigestion also experience heartburn. Heartburn is a pain or burning feeling in the center of your chest during or after eating. The pain or burning feeling may radiate into your neck or back.
Mild indigestion usually is nothing to worry about. Talk with your healthcare professional if symptoms of indigestion last more than two weeks.
