A life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis can cause shock, a sudden drop in blood pressure and trouble breathing. In people who have an allergy, anaphylaxis can happen minutes after exposure to a specific allergy-causing substance, called an allergen. Sometimes, there may be a delayed reaction, or anaphylaxis may happen without an obvious trigger.
Some common anaphylaxis triggers include:
If you're with someone having an allergic reaction with signs of anaphylaxis, call 911 or your local medical emergency number right away.
Don't wait to see whether symptoms get better. Seek emergency treatment right away. Severe untreated anaphylaxis can lead to death within half an hour.
Get emergency treatment even if symptoms start to improve. After anaphylaxis, it's possible for symptoms to start again. Being watched in a hospital for several hours most often is needed.
After you call 911 or your local medical emergency number, do the following:
An antihistamine pill, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), isn't enough to treat anaphylaxis. These medicines can help relieve allergy symptoms, but they work too slowly in a severe reaction. 
Don't give a person who has anaphylaxis anything to drink.
If you've had any kind of severe allergic reaction in the past, ask your healthcare professional if you should be prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector to carry with you.
