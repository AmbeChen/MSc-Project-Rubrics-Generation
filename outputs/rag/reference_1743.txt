Mayo Clinic offers appointments in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota and at Mayo Clinic Health System locations.
Whether the symptoms seem obvious or are more subtle, take them seriously and get immediate medical care.
A heart attack usually causes chest pain for more than 15 minutes. The chest pain may be mild or severe. Some people don't have any chest pain or pressure.
Women tend to have more-vague heart attack symptoms, such as nausea or a brief or sharp pain felt in the neck, arm or back.
Older adults and people with diabetes may have no or very mild symptoms of a heart attack. Never ignore heart attack symptoms, even if they don't seem serious.
Heart attack symptoms can vary widely. For instance, you may have only mild chest discomfort while someone else has severe chest pain.
If you think that you're having a heart attack, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number.
If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are absolutely no other options.
Movies and TV often portray heart attacks as dramatic, chest-clutching events. But heart attacks may begin with subtle symptoms. The chest discomfort may not even be described as pain.
Many people have warning symptoms that happen hours, days or weeks in advance. For example, chest pain or pressure that keeps happening and doesn't go away with rest may be an early warning sign of a heart attack.
Never ignore heart attack symptoms, even if they don't seem serious.
