It's helpful to include stretching in your exercise plan. Stretching can increase flexibility and improve the range of motion in your joints. Being more flexible can help you move more freely and be better able do daily activities. And the flexibility you gain from stretching might protect you from injury.
Balance exercises, such as balancing on one foot, can help prevent and cut the risk of injury from falls too.
Before stretching, warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of light activity. It's usually best to stretch after a workout. Keep stretches gentle and slow. Don't bounce. Breathe through your stretches. If you feel pain, you've stretched too far.
Stretch until you feel a slight pull. Then hold the stretch for about 30 seconds. Repeat the stretch on both sides 2 to 4 times. Aim to stretch major muscle groups in your body at least 2 to 3 days a week.
 If you have health conditions or injuries, talk to a healthcare professional or physical therapist about which stretches are right for you.
