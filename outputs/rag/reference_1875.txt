If your Mayo Clinic doctor prescribes a medication during your visit, your medication may require approval by your insurance provider for coverage. This requirement is called a prescription prior authorization.

The time needed to obtain a prior authorization decision from your insurance provider can range from a few days to a few weeks.
If your insurance changes, a new prior authorization may be required.
Medications that may require a prior authorization include:
Patients are responsible for knowing if their medication will be covered by insurance. Mayo Clinic highly recommends that you contact your insurance company to determine benefits and coverage for prescribed medications. If a medication is not covered by insurance, patients have the option to pay cash or discuss insurance-covered medications with the doctor.
