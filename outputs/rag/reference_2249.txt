Making the decision to have prostate cancer screening depends on a variety of factors. Here are some tips that can help you make a good decision.
Deciding whether to have prostate cancer screening isn't always an easy decision.
Prostate cancer screening can help find prostate cancer early, when treatment is most effective. This seems like a good reason to get screened. But prostate cancer screening isn't perfect. It can lead to more tests and some tests are invasive. Sometimes you have these other tests and they don't find cancer. Sometimes the tests find a cancer that grows slowly and might never actually hurt you. This might lead to cancer treatments that may not have been necessary.
Ultimately, whether to have prostate cancer screening is a decision you make with your healthcare professional. A health professional who understands your health history can help you understand what's best for you based on your risk factors and your personal preferences. Healthcare professionals often call this "shared decision-making."
Here's information to help you get ready to talk with your healthcare professional about prostate cancer screening.
