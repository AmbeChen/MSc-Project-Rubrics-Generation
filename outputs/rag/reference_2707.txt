Is it more effective to floss teeth with a water flosser or with dental floss?
Cleaning between your teeth every day is an important part of keeping your mouth healthy. And there are a variety of tools you can use, depending on your needs. 
Dental floss is an effective tool for cleaning the tight spaces between teeth. It removes the sticky material, called plaque, that can build up in places a toothbrush can't reach. And less plaque means less gum bleeding and a lower risk of gum disease. 
A water flosser is a device that aims a stream of water at the teeth. It's also called an oral irrigator or a dental water jet. A water flosser can help remove pieces of food from between teeth. It also can take plaque off teeth.
If you use dental floss and you don't have gum bleeding or other problems, there's no need to change. Using a water flosser can be helpful for people who have braces, other orthodontics or dental work that makes it hard to use dental floss. A water flosser also may be useful for people who have trouble flossing by hand with dental floss. To lower the risk of contamination with bacteria if you use a water flosser, don't share it with anyone else. 
If plain dental floss gets stuck in your teeth, try waxed floss instead. If you have a hard time handling dental floss, try a floss holder. Other options for cleaning between teeth include interdental brushes, picks or sticks.
To help keep your mouth healthy, clean between your teeth once a day, and brush your teeth twice a day. Get regular dental checkups. If you have questions about flossing and what's right for you, talk with your dentist.
