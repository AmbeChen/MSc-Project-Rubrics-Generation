Medicines that you take by mouth are called oral medicines. They're often the first line of treatment for trouble getting or keeping an erection, called erectile dysfunction (ED). Oral medicines for ED usually work well and cause few side effects.
The four main medicines taken by mouth for erectile dysfunction are:
These medicines are called PDE5 inhibitors. They enhance the effects of a chemical the body makes that relaxes muscles in the penis, called nitric oxide. This boosts blood flow and helps you get an erection from sexual activity.
Each oral medicine for ED has a slightly different chemical makeup. These small differences affect the way each medication works, such as how quickly it takes effect and wears off, and the possible side effects. Your doctor or other health care professional can recommend one for you based on these factors, other health conditions you have and any other medicines you take.

Vardenafil usually works for 4 to 5 hours. Its effects might last longer if you have mild to moderate ED. A newer form of the medicine that dissolves on the tongue might work faster than the pill that you swallow.
These medicines all work well for ED. When choosing one, tell your doctor or other health care professional what your preferences are, such as cost, ease of use, how long the drug's effects last and side effects. Generic versions of sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil are available.
