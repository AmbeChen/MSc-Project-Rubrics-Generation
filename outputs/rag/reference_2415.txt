Trouble sleeping? Sleep aids available without a prescription might help temporarily. But lifestyle changes are usually the best approach for chronic insomnia.
You've followed the usual tips for getting enough sleep. You have a regular sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and daytime naps, and exercise regularly. You also avoid lighted screens before bed and manage stress. Still, it's been weeks since you've had a good night's sleep. Is it time for a nonprescription sleep aid? Here's what you need to know if you're considering medication to help you sleep.
Sleep aids available without a prescription can be effective for an occasional sleepless night. There are a few caveats, however.
Most sleep aids available without a prescription contain antihistamines. Tolerance to the sedative effects of antihistamines can develop quickly. The longer you take them, the less likely they are to make you sleepy.
In addition, some sleep aids available without a prescription can leave you feeling groggy and unwell the next day. This is the so-called hangover effect.
Medication interactions are possible as well, and much remains unknown about the safety and effectiveness of sleep aids available without a prescription.

In addition to lifestyle changes, your provider might recommend behavior therapy. This type of therapy may help you learn new sleep habits and ways to make your sleeping environment more conducive to sleep. In some cases, short-term use of prescription sleep aids might be recommended as well.
