Chronic pelvic pain is pain in the area below the bellybutton and between the hips that lasts six months or longer.
Chronic pelvic pain can have more than one cause. It may be a symptom of another disease, or it can be a condition in its own right.
If chronic pelvic pain seems to be caused by another health condition, treating that problem may get rid of the pain.
But tests may not be able to find a cause for chronic pelvic pain. In that case, the goal of treatment is to ease pain and other symptoms. That could make your quality of life better.
You may feel chronic pelvic pain in different parts of your pelvic area, rather than in just one spot. You might describe the pain in one or more of the following ways:
Chronic pelvic pain may be mild. Or it may be so intense that you miss work and can't sleep or exercise.
In general, see your healthcare professional if the pain disrupts your daily life or if your symptoms seem to get worse.

Chronic pelvic pain is a complex health problem. Sometimes, tests may find that a single disease is the cause. In other cases, the pain may stem from more than one medical condition. For example, you might have endometriosis and interstitial cystitis, both of which play a role in chronic pelvic pain.
Some causes of chronic pelvic pain include:
Many conditions are linked to chronic pelvic pain. Having more than one condition that causes pelvic pain, such as endometriosis and fibroids, raises the risk. A history of sexual or physical abuse also may raise the risk.
