Melatonin is a hormone in your body that plays a role in sleep. The production and release of melatonin in the brain is connected to time of day, increasing when it's dark and decreasing when it's light. Melatonin production declines with age.
Melatonin is also available as a supplement, typically as an oral tablet or capsule. Most melatonin supplements are made in a lab.
People commonly use melatonin for sleep disorders, such as insomnia and jet lag.
Research on melatonin use for specific conditions shows:
Research suggests that melatonin might reduce evening confusion and restlessness in people with Alzheimer's disease, but it doesn't seem to improve cognition.
Your body likely produces enough melatonin for its general needs. However, evidence suggests that melatonin supplements promote sleep and are safe for short-term use. Melatonin can be used to treat delayed sleep phase and circadian rhythm sleep disorders in the blind and provide some insomnia relief. Treat melatonin as you would any sleeping pill and use it under your doctor's supervision.
Melatonin taken orally in appropriate amounts is generally safe. Melatonin can cause:
Less common melatonin side effects might include short-lasting feelings of depression, mild tremor, mild anxiety, abdominal cramps, irritability, reduced alertness, confusion or disorientation.
Because melatonin can cause daytime drowsiness, don't drive or use machinery within five hours of taking the supplement.
Don't use melatonin if you have an autoimmune disease.
