Diagnosing the cause of itchy skin starts with a physical exam and questions about your medical history. If your health care provider thinks your itchy skin is the result of a medical condition, you might have tests, including:
Itchy skin treatment focuses on removing the cause of the itch. If home remedies don't ease your symptoms, your health care provider may recommend prescription medicine or other treatments. Controlling itchy skin symptoms can be challenging and may require long-term therapy. Options include:
Corticosteroid creams and ointments. If your skin is itchy and inflamed, your health care provider may suggest applying a medicated cream or ointment to the affected areas. You might then cover the treated skin with damp cotton material. Moisture helps the skin absorb the cream and has a cooling effect.
If you have severe or long-term itching, your health care provider might suggest this bedtime routine: Bathe in plain lukewarm water for 20 minutes, and then apply triamcinolone .025% to 0.1% ointment to the wet skin. This traps the moisture and helps the medicine absorb. Then put on pajamas. Repeat this routine at bedtime for several nights.
