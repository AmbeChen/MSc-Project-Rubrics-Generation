A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury that affects brain function. Effects are often short term and can include headaches and trouble with concentration, memory, balance, mood and sleep.
Concussions usually are caused by an impact to the head or body that is associated with a change in brain function. Not everyone who experiences a blow to the body or head has a concussion.
Some concussions cause the person to lose consciousness, but most do not.
Falls are the most common cause of concussions. Concussions also are common among athletes who play a contact sport, such as American football or soccer. Most people recover fully after a concussion.
The symptoms of a concussion can be subtle and may not occur right away. Symptoms can last for days, weeks or even longer.
Common symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury are headache, confusion and loss of memory, known as amnesia. The amnesia usually involves forgetting the event that caused the concussion.
Physical symptoms of a concussion may include:
A witness may observe these symptoms in the person with a concussion:
Some symptoms of a concussion occur right away. But sometimes symptoms may not occur for days after the injury, such as:
Concussions can be hard to recognize in infants and toddlers because they can't describe how they feel. Concussion clues may include:
See a healthcare professional within 1 to 2 days if:
Children and adolescents need to see a healthcare professional trained in evaluating and managing pediatric concussions.
Seek emergency care for an adult or child who experiences a head injury and any of these symptoms:
Never return to play or vigorous activity immediately following a concussion. Experts recommend that adult, child and adolescent athletes with concussions not return to play on the same day as the injury. Even if a concussion is suspected, experts recommend not returning to activities that can put the athlete at risk of another concussion. Gradual return to learning and physical activity is individual and depends on the symptoms. It should always be supervised by a healthcare professional.

Common injuries that cause concussions include falls or other direct hits to the head, car accidents, and blast injuries from explosions. These injuries can affect the brain in different ways and cause different types of concussions.
Common injuries that cause concussions include falls or other direct hits to the head, car accidents, and blast injuries from explosions. These injuries can affect the brain in different ways and cause different types of concussions.
During a concussion, the brain slides back and forth against the inner walls of the skull. This forceful movement can be caused by a violent blow to the head and neck or upper body. It also may be caused by the sudden acceleration or deceleration of the head. This may happen during a car crash, a fall from a bike or from a collision with another player in sports.
These movements injure the brain and affect brain function, usually for a brief period of time. Sometimes a mild traumatic brain injury can lead to bleeding in or around the brain, causing prolonged drowsiness, confusion and, sometimes, death. Anyone who experiences a brain injury needs to be monitored in the hours afterward and seek emergency care if symptoms worsen.
Events and factors that may increase the risk of a concussion include:
Having had a previous concussion also increases the risk of having another.
Potential complications of concussion include:
These tips may help you prevent or minimize the risk of a concussion:
Wear protective gear during sports and other recreational activities. Make sure the equipment fits properly, is well maintained and is worn correctly. Follow the rules of the game and practice good sportsmanship.
Be sure to wear a helmet when bicycling, motorcycling, snowboarding or doing any activity that may result in a head injury.
