Medication overuse headaches are the result of the long-term use of medicines needed to treat headaches such as migraines. It's OK to take pain relievers for headaches sometimes. But people who take them more than a couple of days a week may get medication overuse headaches, also called rebound headaches.
For people with a headache condition such as migraine, most medicines for pain relief can have this effect. This doesn't seem true for people who have never had a headache condition. But people with a history of headaches who take pain relievers regularly for another condition, such as arthritis, may get medicine overuse headaches.

This group also includes combined prescription medicines that have the sedative butalbital (Butapap, Lanorinal, others). Medicines with butalbital have a high risk of causing medication overuse headaches. It's best not to take them to treat headaches.
