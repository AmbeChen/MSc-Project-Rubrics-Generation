The morning-after pill is a type of emergency birth control, also called emergency contraception. It can help prevent pregnancy after sex if your regular birth control method didn't work or wasn't used.

Levonorgestrel is sold without a prescription. Ulipristal acetate is available only with a prescription.

Emergency birth control is an effective way to prevent pregnancy after sex without protection. But it doesn't work as well as other types of birth control. And emergency contraception isn't meant for routine use. Also, the morning-after pill might not work even if you use it correctly. And it doesn't protect you from sexually transmitted infections.
The morning-after pill isn't right for everyone. Don't take a morning-after pill if:
If you're overweight or obese, the morning-after pill might not work as well as it would for people who aren't overweight.
Also, make sure you're not pregnant before using ulipristal. The effects of ulipristal on a developing baby aren't known. If you're breastfeeding, do not take ulipristal.
Side effects of the morning-after pill often last only a few days. They can include:
For the morning-after pill to work best, take it as soon as possible after sex without protection. You need to use it within five days, or 120 hours, for it to work. You can take emergency birth control pills anytime during your menstrual cycle.
Using the morning-after pill may delay your period by up to one week. If you don't get your period within three weeks of taking the morning-after pill, take a pregnancy test.
Most often, you don't need to contact your healthcare professional after using the morning-after pill. But you should call your healthcare professional if you have any of the following symptoms:
These can be symptoms of a miscarriage. These also can be symptoms of a pregnancy that forms outside the uterus, called an ectopic pregnancy. Without treatment, an ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening for someone who's pregnant.
