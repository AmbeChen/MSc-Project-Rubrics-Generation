Nighttime panic attacks, also known as nocturnal panic attacks, can occur with no clear cause and awaken you from sleep. As with a daytime panic attack, you may sweat, have a rapid heart rate, tremble, be short of breath or breathe heavily. You also may feel flushed or chilled, be lightheaded, and feel a sense of impending doom. These alarming symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack or another serious medical condition. Although panic attacks are not comfortable, they aren't dangerous.
Nighttime panic attacks usually last only a few minutes. But it may take a while to calm down and go back to sleep after you have one. People who have nighttime panic attacks also tend to have daytime panic attacks.
It's not known what causes panic attacks. Underlying factors may include genetics, stress and certain changes in the way parts of your brain work. In some cases, an underlying condition, such as a sleep disorder, asthma or a thyroid condition, can cause symptoms of panic. Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about your symptoms and whether you need any tests for a possible underlying condition.
Nighttime panic attacks are treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, also called CBT, or medicines or both. CBT helps you learn how to retrain your body to react less to panic symptoms and manage anxious thoughts better so that you respond to panic attacks in a more effective way. These treatments can help make panic attacks less intense and prevent them in the future so you can get better sleep.
