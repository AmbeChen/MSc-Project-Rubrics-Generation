The purpose of treatment is to ease gender dysphoria. Specific goals for gender dysphoria treatment depend on the person.
If you have gender dysphoria, it's important to find a healthcare professional who has expertise in the care of gender-diverse people. If you need help, you can look online for organizations such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). WPATH offers a search on its website that can find healthcare professionals in your area who work with transgender and gender-diverse people.
Treatment for gender dysphoria can include changes in gender expression, hormone therapy, surgery and supportive behavioral health therapy.
Gender expression involves how gender is shown to the world through the way a person looks or acts. Gender expression may include clothing, mannerisms, communication style and interests, among other things. Changes in gender expression to ease gender dysphoria can involve dressing, speaking and behaving in ways that are more consistent with a person's gender identity.
Medical treatment of gender dysphoria might include:
Specific medical treatment is based on a person's goals, along with an evaluation of the risks and benefits. Treatments also may be based on other conditions a person has. Social and economic issues may play a role in creating a treatment plan too.

Gender dysphoria often can be eased by being in a supportive environment. Social support from family, friends and other loved ones may help prevent depression, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, anxiety or high-risk behaviors.
Talking to other transgender or gender-diverse people also may help. Ask your healthcare professional about support groups in your area. Some community centers or LGBTQ+ centers have support groups. Online support groups are available too.
Joining an LGBTQ+ organization can help you build community and may offer useful support. Or consider getting involved in other community organizations where you feel comfortable and supported expressing your gender identity.
You may start by seeing your primary healthcare professional. Or you may be referred to a behavioral health professional.
