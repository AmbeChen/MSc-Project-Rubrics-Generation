Some risk factors for breast cancer are within your control to change. These include:
Other risk factors for cancerous breast lumps can't be controlled. These include:
Some conditions that cause breast lumps may lead to other health concerns, also called complications. The complications depend on the type of breast lump that you have. For example, without treatment, some breast infections can cause pockets of pus to form in the breast.
Other breast conditions that are not cancer still can raise the risk of breast cancer later on. These include conditions that can cause lumps, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. If you have a breast condition that raises the risk of cancer, it doesn't mean that you'll definitely get breast cancer. Ask your healthcare professional what the risk means for you and whether you can make lifestyle changes to lower it.
Some breast lumps don't cause complications. For example, small cysts and simple fibroadenomas sometimes go away on their own over time.
There's no clear way to prevent many breast lumps. Breast lumps that are not cancer often are linked with natural changes in the body, such as hormonal changes over time.
But some risk factors for cancerous breast lumps are within your power to change. Take the following steps to lower your chances of breast cancer:
