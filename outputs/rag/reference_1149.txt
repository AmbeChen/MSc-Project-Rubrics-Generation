A bee sting is a common outdoor nuisance. You can take several steps to avoid stings from bees, hornets and wasps. If you're stung, basic first aid can help ease the pain of a mild or moderate reaction. You may need emergency medical help for a severe reaction.
Bee sting symptoms can range from pain and swelling to a life-threatening allergic reaction. Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will be more severe.

Generally, insects such as bees and wasps aren't aggressive and only sting in self-defense. In most cases, this results in one or perhaps a few stings. Some types of bees tend to swarm, stinging in a group. An example of this type of bee is Africanized bees.
