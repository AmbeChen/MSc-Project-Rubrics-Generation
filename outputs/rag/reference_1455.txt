You can tell the difference between a cold and a seasonal allergy by key symptoms and how regularly symptoms appear.
Colds are caused by your immune system's response when you catch a virus. Seasonal allergies are triggered by your immune system's response to allergens, such as pollen.
Some symptoms of colds and allergic reactions are the same, such as a runny or stuffy nose, and sneezing.
For example, people with seasonal allergies almost never have a sore throat or a cough. Viral infections, on the other hand, often do cause this symptom. And people with seasonal allergies don't usually have a fever, but those with a cold often do. With a seasonal allergy, you may notice puffy eyelids and dark marks under your eyes.
A cold may last 3 to 10 days in adults, although a cough may last for a couple of weeks longer. You can treat the symptoms of the common cold with rest and added fluids. Pain relievers may help with aching muscles or throat pain. Nasal rinses or sprays may help with congestion or runny nose.
Seasonal allergies may last several weeks. You can treat seasonal allergies with a nasal saline rinse, antihistamines or nasal steroid sprays. Avoid exposure to allergens where possible.
