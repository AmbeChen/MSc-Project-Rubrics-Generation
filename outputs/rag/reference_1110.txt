Thinking about a planned home birth? Understand the possible risks and how to plan and prepare for the big day.
If you're considering a planned home birth, you probably have questions. Is it safe? Will you need a midwife or doula? How do you create a backup plan? Find out what's involved and what to consider as you decide if delivering your baby at home is right for you.

It's important to talk to your health care provider before you make a decision about a planned home birth. For some people with certain health conditions, as well as those who have not given birth before, the risks of a planned home birth may be higher than they are for others.
One of the most important steps in planning for a home birth is finding well-trained health care providers to assist you. It is common for a midwife to provide care during a home birth. If you choose a midwife, make sure that person is one of the following:
Although it is uncommon, in some areas, doctors who specialize in obstetrics may be available to assist with home births. Make sure the health care provider you choose has easy access to doctors or specialists at a nearby hospital.

If you're interested in having more help, consider hiring a professional labor assistant (doula).
If you haven't done so before, consider taking a childbirth class to help you prepare, so you know what to expect during labor and delivery. Such a class also can give you time to talk with other expectant parents and come up with more questions or topics to consider for your birth plan.
Discuss your birth plan with your health care provider. Go over your expectations and make a list of the equipment and supplies you'll need to meet those expectations and ensure a safe experience for you and your baby. Share the plan with others who will be supporting you during labor and delivery. This will help everyone understand what you want, so you can feel safe, supported and confident in your birth experience.
Make the following preparations for a smooth transition to a hospital, if you need it:
Hospitals or certified birth centers are the safest settings for delivery. However, you have the right to make an informed decision about where you prefer to deliver your baby. Keep in mind that life-threatening problems can occur during labor and delivery. In those cases, the need to take you and your baby to a hospital could delay care. That could put your lives at risk. Understand the risks and benefits of a home birth before you make a decision about where to deliver.
