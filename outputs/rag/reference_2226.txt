Oral health begins with clean teeth. Hold your toothbrush at a slight angle against your teeth and brush with short back-and-forth motions. Brush the outside, inside and chewing surfaces of your teeth, as well as your tongue. Floss your teeth one at a time, rubbing the floss against the side of the tooth in an up-and-down motion.
