Some people claim that coconut oil can help with many health conditions. That includes underactive thyroid, also called hypothyroidism. But there's no high-quality research to support the claim that coconut oil can cure hypothyroidism.
If you have symptoms of hypothyroidism, talk to your healthcare professional. Examples of hypothyroidism symptoms include more sensitivity to cold than usual, often being very tired, dry skin, constipation and memory problems. Blood tests can show if the thyroid isn't working properly.
If you have hypothyroidism, effective treatment is available. Treatment for hypothyroidism usually involves taking the thyroid hormone medicine levothyroxine (Levo-T, Synthroid, others) every day. This medicine is taken by mouth. It returns hormone levels to a healthy range. That makes the symptoms of hypothyroidism go away.
If you've already been diagnosed with an underactive thyroid, follow your healthcare professional's directions for taking thyroid hormone medicine. If you take thyroid hormone medicine and you still have symptoms, tell your healthcare professional. The dose of your medicine may need to be changed.
Although there's no cure for an underactive thyroid, its symptoms often can be successfully controlled.
