Heart-healthy eating doesn't have to be difficult. Use these menus to get started on a heart-healthy diet.
Do you want to follow a heart-healthy diet, but aren't sure where to start? One way to begin is to create a daily meal plan. The plan should include plenty of lean protein, vegetables, fruits and whole grains. Limit high-fat foods such as red meat, cheese and baked goods. Also limit foods that are high in sodium such as sandwiches, pizza, soup and processed foods. Cut back on foods and drinks with added sugar too.
Below are two days' worth of heart-healthy menus. Use them as examples of heart-healthy eating.
