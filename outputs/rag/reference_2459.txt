Most tick bites are painless and cause only minor signs and symptoms, such as a change in skin color, swelling or a sore on the skin.
But some ticks spread bacteria that cause illnesses, including Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In general, to spread Lyme disease a tick needs to be attached to a person's skin for at least 36 hours. Other infections can be transferred in a few hours or even a few minutes.
Call 911 or your local emergency number if you develop:
The rash gets bigger. A small bump may appear at the site of the tick bite. This is typical. If it develops into a larger rash or you develop a rash anywhere, possibly with a bull's-eye pattern, it may be a sign of Lyme disease. The rash usually appears within 3 to 14 days.
Consult your provider even if the rash disappears because you may still be at risk of having the disease. Your risk of contracting a disease from a tick bite depends on where you live or travel to, how much time you spend outside in woody and grassy areas, and how well you protect yourself.
If possible, bring the tick, or a photo of the tick, with you to your doctor's appointment.
