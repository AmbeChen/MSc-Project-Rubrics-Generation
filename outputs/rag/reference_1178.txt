False beliefs about mental illness can cause problems for people with mental health conditions. Learn what you can do about this stigma.
Stigma is when people think badly of you because of something that they see as negative. Sadly, many people have negative attitudes and beliefs about people who have mental illness. Even the term "mental illness" can add to the stigma. Many people prefer the term "mental health condition." 
Stigma can lead to discrimination. Discrimination may be obvious and direct, such as someone making a negative comment about your mental health condition or treatment. Or it may be subtle or not meant to hurt. For example, someone might avoid you because the person assumes you aren't stable, or even that you could be violent or dangerous, due to your mental health condition. You may even judge yourself. 
Here are some ways you can deal with stigma:
Judgments by other people often come from not understanding mental health conditions. Learn to accept your condition, look for support, and help teach others about your condition. This can make a big difference in your quality of life.
