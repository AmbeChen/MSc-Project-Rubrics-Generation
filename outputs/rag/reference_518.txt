Leg pain can be constant or come and go. It may start suddenly or get worse over a period of time. It may affect your entire leg or only a specific area, such as your shin or your knee. Leg pain may be worse during certain times, such as during the night or first thing in the morning. Leg pain may worsen with activity and get better when resting. You may feel leg pain as stabbing, sharp, dull, aching or tingling.
Some leg pain is simply annoying. But more-severe leg pain can affect your ability to walk or to put weight on your leg.
