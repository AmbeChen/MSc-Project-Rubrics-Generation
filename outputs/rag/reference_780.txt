Using electronic cigarettes, called vaping, during pregnancy is not safe.
Most electronic cigarettes contain nicotine, which permanently damages a baby's developing brain and many other organs. Electronic cigarettes also are called e-cigarettes.
E-cigarette liquids also contain chemicals, flavors, and other additives that may not be safe for you or your baby.
It's well known that smoking cigarettes during pregnancy can harm people and their babies. But research suggests that people who vape while pregnant believe that using e-cigarettes is less harmful than smoking cigarettes. They often don't think e-cigarettes contain nicotine. Some also may use e-cigarettes during pregnancy because of the idea that the devices can help them quit or cut back cigarette smoking.
While use of e-cigarettes might expose a growing baby to fewer toxins compared with those from regular cigarette use, nicotine exposure of any kind is harmful to a baby. And the flavorings, solvents, and other chemicals in e-cigarettes may harm you and your baby.
If you're pregnant and you smoke or vape, quitting is the best way to give your baby a healthy start. Begin by talking with your healthcare professional. Ask about resources to help you quit.
