A puncture wound, such as from stepping on a nail, doesn't usually cause much bleeding. But these wounds are often deep and can be dangerous because of the risk of infection.
Seek medical care if your wound shows signs of infection, such as:
If you haven't had a tetanus shot in the past five years and the wound is deep or dirty, your health care professional may recommend a booster. You should have a booster shot within 48 hours of your injury.
If the wound was caused by a cat or a dog, try to confirm that its rabies vaccination is up to date. If it was caused by a wild animal, seek advice from your doctor about which animals are most likely to carry rabies.
