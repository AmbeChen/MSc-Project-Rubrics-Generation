Dizziness is a term that people use to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, woozy, weak or wobbly. The sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is more precisely termed vertigo.
Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults see a healthcare professional. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can have serious effects on your life. But dizziness rarely means that you have a life-threatening condition.
Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. Treatment often helps, but the symptoms may come back.

In general, see your healthcare professional if you have any repeated, sudden, severe, or long-lasting dizziness or vertigo with no clear cause.

Loop-shaped canals in the inner ear contain fluid and fine, hairlike sensors that help with keeping balance. At the base of the canals are the utricle and saccule, each containing a patch of sensory hair cells. Within these cells are tiny particles called otoconia that help monitor the position of the head in relation to gravity and linear motion, such as going up and down in an elevator or moving forward and backward in a car.
