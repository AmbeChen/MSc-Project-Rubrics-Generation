The colon, also called the large intestine, is a long tubelike organ in the abdomen. The colon carries waste to be expelled from the body. The rectum makes up the last several inches of the large intestine.

Microscopic colitis is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the large intestine. This large intestine is also called the colon. Microscopic colitis causes symptoms of watery diarrhea.
The condition gets its name from needing to look at colon tissue under a microscope to diagnose it. The tissue appears typical on exam with a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy.
There are two subtypes of microscopic colitis:
Researchers believe collagenous (kuh-LAYJ-uh-nus) colitis and lymphocytic colitis may be forms of the same condition. Symptoms, testing and treatment are the same for both subtypes.
The symptoms of microscopic colitis can come and go. At times, symptoms improve on their own.
If you have watery diarrhea that lasts more than a few days, contact your healthcare professional to diagnose and treat your condition.
